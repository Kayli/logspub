      - idea can only represent the object (podium) if it resembles it
      - but how can idea that is not in space at all can represent a massive object in space?
      - the idea of the mind interacting with the brain does not have any sense (is not consistent)

  - direct realism: we experience objects independent of the mind
  - representationalism: we experience objects but representations of the objects are different from the objects themselves, such objects are independent of the mind
