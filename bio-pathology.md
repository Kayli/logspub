# notes about pathology, diseases and related topics

## basic definitions

- pathology 
  - is the study of the causes and effects of disease or injury
- medical condition
  - broad term that includes all diseases, lesions, disorders, or nonpathologic condition that normally receives 
    medical treatment, such as pregnancy or childbirth
  - general medical condition
    - refers to all diseases, illnesses, and injuries except for mental disorders
- disorder
  - disruption to regular bodily structure and function
- disease
  - the term is used to refer specifically to infectious diseases
    - which are clinically evident diseases that result from the presence of pathogenic microbial agents, including
      viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, multicellular organisms, and aberrant proteins known as prions
  - associated with the dysfunction of the body's normal homeostatic processes
- illness and sickness
  - both generally used as synonyms for disease
  - is occasionally used to refer specifically to the patient's personal experience of his or her disease
- syndrome
  - collection of signs and symptoms associated with a specific health-related cause

- related fields of study
  - microbiology
  - virology
  - parasitology
  - immunology
  - epidemiology
  - psychopathology?


## infections

- about 8% of human genome is viral
- cytokine storm
  - also called hypercytokinemia
  - physiological reaction in humans and other animals in which the innate immune system causes an 
    uncontrolled and excessive release of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules called cytokines. 
    Normally, cytokines are part of the body's immune response to infection, but their sudden release 
    in large quantities can cause multisystem organ failure and death.


### bacterial

- bubonic plague
  - caused by the bacterium 'yersinia pestis'
  - alt names: black death, pestilence


### viral

- virus
  - submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism

- types of viruses
  - rna
    - icosahedral
      - naked: reo, birna, calici, picorna
      - enveloped: flavi, toga, retro
    - helical and enveloped
      - corona, filo, rhabdo, bunya, orthomyxo, paramyxo, arena
  - dna
    - icosahedral
      - naked: parvo, papova, adeno
      - enveloped: hepadna, herpes
      - cytoplasmic: irido
    - helical and enveloped
      - baculo
    - complex
      - pox
    
  - retroviruses
    - rna virus that creates and embeds dna into cell machinery to reproduce itself
    - endogenus retrovirus
      - embeds itself into reproductive cells
      - passed to new generations of the organism
    - help to develop new adaptations over large timespans
      - placenta is an example of such organ that gets developed with the help of a viral protein
        - evolved in the common ancestor of placental mammals, which almost all living mammals

- well known
  - smallpox (оспа)
  - rabies (бешенство)


### mixed cause

- pneumonia (воспаление лёгких)
  - inflammatory condition of the lung primarily affecting alveoli
    - alveoli are where the lungs and the blood exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide 
      during the process of breathing in and breathing out
  - caused by infection with viruses or bacteria
    - identifying the responsible pathogen can be difficult


## genetic diseases

### williams syndrome

- rare genetic disorder characterized by 
  - growth delays before and after birth (prenatal and postnatal growth retardation)
  - short stature
  - a varying degree of mental deficiency
  - distinctive facial features that typically become more pronounced with age

- interesting studies
  - the first hint of a link between dogs and Williams syndrome came in 2010, when evolutionary biologist 
    - bridgett vonHoldt and her colleagues examined DNA from 225 wolves and 912 dogs from 85 breeds. 
    - they were looking for parts of the genome that have been shaped by selection since dogs diverged from wolves [^1]
    
  - to understand the process of dog diversification better
    - scientists conducted an extensive genome-wide survey of more than 48,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      in dogs and their wild progenitor, the grey wolf

  - deletion of genes GTF2I and GTF2IRD1 in people causes Williams syndrome
    - which is characterized by elfin facial features
    - cognitive difficulties
    - tendency to love everyone


## psychopathology

- dsm
  - diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders
  - last revision is dsm-5 published in 2013

- pseudohallucination
  - involuntary sensory experience vivid enough to be regarded as a hallucination, 
    but which is recognised by the person experiencing it as being subjective and unreal. 
  - by contrast, a "true" hallucination is perceived as entirely real by the person experiencing it
  - patients can be easily misdiagnosed in a case of gaslighting

- aggravation
  - exaggeration by the subject of the described severity of symptoms that are actually present or are subjectively felt
  - can act as a consciously determined activity or have a subconscious character of occurrence
  - the causes of aggravation of painful symptoms can be determined by
    - the true presence of the disease
    - by personality-motivational characteristics of a person

- delirious intuition (autochthonous)
  - and describes the expression of thoughts that have no apparent basis in inference
  - is a relevant term for the fields of psychiatry and psychology
  - возникший вне связи с какими-либо внешними причинами, обстоятельствами

- hyperkinesia
  - refers to an increase in muscular activity that can result in 
    - excessive abnormal movements, 
    - excessive normal movements 
    - or a combination of both
  - is a state of excessive restlessness which is featured in a large variety of disorders that affect 
    the ability to control motor movement, such as Huntington's disease

- hypokinesia 
  - movement disorder referring to decreased bodily movement
  - characterized by a partial or complete loss of muscle movement due to a disruption in the basal ganglia

- cotard's syndrome
  - is a rare neuropsychiatric condition
  - patient denies existence of one's own body to the extent of delusions of immortality
  - one of the consequences of Cotard's syndrome is self-starvation because of negation of existence of self

- neurosis
  - is a class of functional mental disorders involving chronic distress, but neither delusions nor hallucinations
  
- psychosis
  - abnormal condition of the mind that results in difficulties determining what is real and what is not real
  - psychotic episode - обострение
  - ?раптус "raptus melancholicus" на фоне депрессивных, меланхолических состояний?

- kandinsky–clérambault syndrome (syndrome of the psychic automatism)
  - considered to be a typical feature of paranoid schizophrenia
  - characterized by
    - pseudohallucinations
    - delusions of control
    - telepathy, thought broadcasting and thought insertion by an external force
    - delusion of being controlled by a source outside himself

- comorbidity
  - presence of one or more additional conditions often co-occurring (that is, concomitant or concurrent) with a primary condition

- bipolar disorder [^3]
  - previously known as manic depression
  - is a mood disorder
    - characterized by periods of depression and
    - periods of abnormally-elevated mood that last from days to weeks each
    - if the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania
    - if it is less severe, it is called hypomania

- dissociation [^4]
  - dissociative episode
    - may include different manifestations described below
  - dissociative amnesia: e.g. forgetting stressful episode or associated memories
  - maladaptive daydreaming
    - having more fun with your imagination than with real life
    - to be maladaptive it should have bad consequences for the one who disengages
  - depersonalization
    - disconnection from our own thoughts, feelings, sensations, body or actions
  - derealization
    - feeling like everything is a fake, living in a movie
