## negotiation manipulative tactics

- inspired by a bunch of half-truths and misconceptions written at [4]

- negotiation tactic
  - is a single maneuver to be employed in the heat of battle (as compared to a negotiation strategy)
    - why 'battle'??
      - aren't we cooperating towards a common goal?
      - isn't universe abundant to provide best conditions for every human being involved?
        - oh, you can't fly too far, i'm wondering why .... :_(
        - and you also creating life and throwing it out to rot on the asphalt of your sink cities
  
  - a move, countermove or adjustment
    - employed as you work to gain the best possible outcome at any given moment

  - manipulative use
    - to move you from a position of safety to a place where you are more vulnerable to attack
    - as a negotiator, you must be prepared for such tactics at every turn

- tactics
  - pressure
    - deadlines
      - person setting deadline is counting on the fact that it’s slave nature to believe deadlines are real, slaveowner bs heritage
      - the very framing of the problem is already broken and terminology is poisoned
      - instead of inspiring people to enjoy their work, slaveowners try to brainwash them using a bunch of manipulative rethorical tricks

    - competition
      - is healthy in a market economy and should be respected, not neutralized
        - not to be confused with pathological dog-eats-dog competition inside company
          - instead, people should collaborate, help, inspire each other
      - legal abstractions should be involved in competition (as they can't suffer, see harrari's works)
        - while people should be involved in cooperation and learn to be detached from legal abstractions, without compromising their (personal) dignity/security
      - overall, potential distructive effects on people involved have to be forseen and avoided/minimized

    - delaying
      - to take advantage of a stronger negotiating position at a later time
      - to construct belief in higher source of power via exploiting sunk cost fallacy

  - tbd
    - manipulative
    - power (one-up)
    - collaborative
