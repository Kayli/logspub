# lecture notes about nutrition and related topics


## food energy

- cells convert glucose to ATP in a process called cellular respiration
- glucose
  - simple sugar or monosacharide
  - 1 molecule produces 30 ATP

- hydrolysis of 1 mole of ATP into ADP releases 30.5 kilo joules or 7.5 kilo calories of energy

- кислород не требуется для протекания гликолиза
  - в аэробных условиях пировиноградная кислота далее декарбоксилируется
    - соединяется с коферментом А и вовлекается в цикл Кребса
  - в анаэробных условиях (при гипоксии) пируват восстанавливается до молочной кислоты 
    - либо претерпевает дальнейшие превращения в ходе брожения

- citric acid cycle (krebs cycle)
  - series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to release stored energy
    - from derivative (acetyl-CoA) of carbohydrates, fats or protein
  - happens through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA


## essential nutrients

- definition 
  - a nutrient required for normal physiological function 
  - that cannot be synthesized in the body either at all or in sufficient quantities
    - and thus must be obtained from a dietary source

- macronutrients
  - from several grams to hundreds grams of daily consumption
  - non-organic 
    - water, Na+, Cl-, Mg2+, K2+, Ca, H2PO4- (остаток фосфорной кислоты)
  - organic
    - carbohydrates
      - monosacharides (glucose)
      - polysacharides (starch)
    - lipids
      - omega-3, omega-6
      - foods: plant-based oils, fish

- micronutrients
  - milligrams of daily consumption
    
- 21 amino acids are common to all life forms
- 8 essential amino acids humans cannot synthesize 
  - valine
  - threonine
  - tryptophan
  - methionine
  - leucine
  - isoleucine
  - lysine
  - histidine
- 2 fatty acids
- 13 vitamins
- 15 minerals

- warning: data above looks sketchy (taken from wikipedia on May 17, 2021)
  - as there should be probability distributions instead of just numbers
  - just keep in mind that 'nutrition science' is not a real science yet :(
    - with lots of frauds, liers, fucked-up people who like to slowly kill their own kids
      - that means that they are most likely
        - very stupid
        - delusional
        - uneducated
        - disconnected from reality or live in a different reality (billioners?)
        - or all of the above


## cancer

- presence of cancerous cells are norm in human body
  - its about their concentrations, aggregations and ability of an organism to neutralize them in a timeley manner
  - healthy immune system is a key here
- 95% energy of cancerous cells are getting through glicolysis
  - only 2 ATP molectules are produced as a result of reaction (glucose -> NAD + 2 ATP)


## ethics

- 'memetic toxicity' may be a new dimension allowing to define ethical aspects of food production/consumption
- verification of incoming information will be a key to get compliance
  - how do you know that certification companies are doing their job well?
    - it shouldn't be just a blind trust, that shit doesn't work
  - do farms have 24/7 cameras monitoring their livestock?
    - are live videostreams available to the public?
    - how genuine those streams are?
- do animals become liberated in a long run?
  - think from infinite game-theoretical perspective
  - do livestock companies invest in future freedom of their animals?
    - if yes, how?
    - controlling animals in some subtle ways may be a key
      - so that they just 'fall asleep' when its time for them to go

- main idea
  - it doesn't have to be ideal right now, but there should be tangible steps taken towards achieving 
    more freedom for animals, including people ...

- faq
  - should cucumbers be liberated as well?
    - no, as they are not memetically toxic (except maybe a pickle-rick)
      - if you know that billions of animals are getting killed on a regular basis, it 
        has pretty clear tangible implications for people: once you're able to kill animal
        who looks in certain aspects like a human, you will be more likely to be able to harm humans
      - so there are pretty clear concequences of 'memetic toxicity'
        - especially once people are getting more imaginative

  - controversial
    - why not focus on humans instead of animals first?
      - humans have greater potential to think for themselves, while animals not that much
      - humans are more manipulative, so that you will likely fail helping them effectively
        - they may invent all sorts of reasons why you need to give them more attention than to animals
        - they may hide their true needs more effectively
