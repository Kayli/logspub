# notes related to a topic of machine learning

## basics

- major types of ML
  - supervised learning
    - it is most common ML method, but is defferent from RL
    - deals with labeled data and training sets
  - unsupervised learning
    - uncovering hidden structures in unlabeled data
  - reinforcement learning
    - agent interacting over time with its environment to achieve a goal
    - tasks that RL focuses on: sensation, action, goal

- data augmentation in pattern recognition
  - altering input data by introduction of small transformations/disturbances
  - goals
    - make recognition more robust
    - extract invariant representations of detected phenomenon


## popular libraries

- tensorflow
- pytorch
- onnx (pronounced like onyx)
