## educational videos for toddlers

- teletubbies [^1]
  - adults may have some ideas watching that too
  - not quite sure why characters intentionally mix 'hello' and 'o-oh' messages
    - hypothesis: to teach toddler how to distinguish similarly sounding sound queues based on 
        other visual and social queues so that familiar (greeting a friend) can be differentiated 
        from encountering with unknown (magic windmill)
  - conditioning observed
    - magic windmil (encounter with unknown) -> anxiety -> gathering -> tv (programming, belly association)
    - belly subconsciously associated with umbilical cord, so tv gets associated with feeding on a subconscious level
