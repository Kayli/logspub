# notes about philosophers [^1]

## donald david hoffman 1955

- multimodal user interface (MUI) theory
  - he was running computer simulations of artificial worlds with agents
  - there were artificial 'reality' and artificial 'agents' adapting to it

  - models of reality that agents built in order to adapt were different from reality itself
    - proves that there are no evolutionary reasons for a map to become identical to a territory
  
  - interesting aspect is that he once again brings attention to the fact that physics is
    just our model of reality which we use to adapt and it is different from reality itself

- another idea that is worth noting is that map creates reality of its own
  - connects multiple modalities into a coherent stream of consciousness
    - like picture on a wall triggers stream of associations in our experience, so it is no longer
      just a picture as a physical object
