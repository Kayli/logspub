# notes about philosophers [^1]


## donald david hoffman 1955

- multimodal user interface (MUI) theory
  - he was running computer simulations of artificial worlds with agents
  - there were artificial 'reality' and artificial 'agents' adapting to it

  - models of reality that agents built in order to adapt were different from reality itself
    - proves that there are no evolutionary reasons for a map to become identical to a territory (haha)
  
  - interesting aspect is that he once again brings attention to the fact that physics is
    just our model of reality which we use to adapt and it is different from reality itself

- another idea that is worth noting is that map creates reality of its own
  - connects multiple modalities into a coherent stream of consciousness
    - like picture on a wall triggers stream of associations in our experience, so it is no longer
      just a picture as a physical object

- extends structuralist's notion of signs

- meaning is generative 
  - we can always find new ways of describing sign through other signs
  - sometimes referred as generative polysemy
- when we communicate, we must suppress unwanted meanings
- phonocentrism: privilege of speech over writing
- logocentrism
  - when signs presuppose direct or immediate relationship to an object or a content (transcendental signified)
  - western philosophy tries to control meanings of words
- deconstruction is derrida's attempt to show inconsistencies in philosophical writings by exposing
  inherent ambiguities of sign interpretations

    - e.g. scientific inquiry to science, artistic to art ...
  - guardians of rationality

## joseph margolis 1924-2021

- cognition and the world are symbiotic (no access to things in themselves)
  - worlded language and languaged world

- no universal bivalence (certain statements are either true or false)
  - bivalence claim is applicable in some areas (math), but may not be in others (history)
  - often it is perfectly reasonable to relax bivalence requirement
    - as our judjements are not detachable from evidence
  - truth is relative to fields of evidence
    - historical, esthetical or art judgements
    - allows multiple objective but incompatible interpretations
  
- turning to pragmatic biological grounds
  - human inquiry develops out of the biological and precognitive interaction between organism and environment
