# notes on quantum mechanics

- simplest wavefunction
  - electrons are the simplest quantum objects to model
    - they hold certain resemblence to many physical objects
      - e.g. pieces of plastic or our planet
      - rotational and magnetic axis coincide
      - ball rotating around its own axis behaves like a bar magnet
    - key differences
      - radius is 0, so its a point-particle        
      - mass is unmeasurable at the moment
      - however, wikipedia says that
        - electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton
        - upper limit of the particle's radius to be 10−22 meters.
        - the upper bound of the electron radius of 10−18 meters can be derived using the uncertainty relation in energy ???
      - has a spin
        - it has little in common with spinning of a physical object
        - fixed magnitude
          - cant be sped up or slowed down
    - has angular momentum
    - has a spin
      - is a hidden variable which defines if a photon will be emitted when electron exposed to a magnetic field
        - not clear
          - only when within an atom? (a standing wave, debroile hypothesis)
          - or even when in unbounded sate, flying lineraly through space in a vacuum (a hidden variable of an electron)
    - helicity is a sum of an orbital angular momentum and a spin

  - wavefunction of an electron
    - external part: motion through space
    - intrinsic part: deals with spin
    - measuring spin of the electron
      - interesting article https://www.gregschool.org/gregschoollessons/2017/5/23/measuring-the-spin-of-an-electron-e5rzd-gmtdl
      - experimentally, it has been demonstrated that no matter what direction the spin is initially pointing in, 
        either one of two things will happen when the electron’s spin aligns with the magnetic field: 
          - either the electron will emit no radiation - called "spin up"
          - or it will emit exactly one photon - called "spin down"
      - the electron’s initially prepared spin can be in any direction but, oddly, when you measure the spin it is always only up or down


## heisenberg uncertainty principle

- is a general principle of the universe
- states that it is impossible to measure position and momentum simultaneously with infinite precision
  - measure one well and the other will be measured poorly

- it is impossible to determine the position of an object to a precision smaller than the planck length [1]
  - shown in 1964 by alden mead, used the uncertainty principle and the gravitational effect of the photon 

- analogous examples in macro-world
  - temperature of liquid decreases a bit when thermometer placed into it
  - lawyer's manner of questioning will influence answers

- but it does not describe observer effect
  - delayed choice experiment
    - splits photons into two: "signal" and "witness"
    - shows that even measuring "witness" photons collapses wave function for boh "signal" and "witness"
  - observer effect is removed from "signal" part of the experimental setup
    - but collapse happens there anyways


## qm interpretations

- copenhagen
  - set of ideas/principles attributed to Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg
  - quantum mechanics is intrinsically indeterministic
    - probabilities calculated using the Born rule: probability density of finding a system in a given state, when measured, is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the system's wavefunction at that state
  - principle of complementarity
    - objects have certain pairs of complementary properties which cannot all be observed or measured simultaneously
  - act of "observing" or "measuring" an object is irreversible
  - no truth can be attributed to an object except according to the results of its measurement
  - quantum descriptions are objective (not subjective)

- many worlds
  - universal wavefunction obeys the same deterministic, reversible laws at all times
  - there is no wavefunction collapse associated with measurement
    - measurements are explained by decoherence, which occurs when states interact with the environment
    - parts of the wavefunction describing observers become increasingly entangled with the parts of the wavefunction describing their experiments
  -  observations "split" the universe into mutually unobservable alternate histories

- quantum information theories
  - describe an observer's knowledge of the world, rather than the world itself
    - has some similarity with Bohr's thinking
  - collapse (also known as reduction) is often interpreted as an observer acquiring information from a measurement, rather than as an objective event
  - in qbism, quantum state is not an element of reality—instead it represents the degrees of belief an agent has about the possible outcomes of measurements
