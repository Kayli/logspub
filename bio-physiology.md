# human physiology

## basics

- cranial nerves
  - are the nerves that emerge directly from the brain (including the brainstem)
  - of which there are conventionally considered twelve pairs


## endocrine system

- human body secretes and circulates some 50 different hormones
- 3 classes: polypeptides, amines, steroids

- notable steroids
  - sex hormones
    - androgens
    - estrogens
    - progestogens
  - corticosteroids
    - glucocorticoids
      - regulate many aspects of metabolism and immune function
      - examples: cortisol
    - mineralocorticoids
      - help maintain blood volume and control renal excretion of electrolytes
  - anabolic steroids


## autonomic nervous system

- responsible for regulating the body's unconscious actions

- divisions
  - sympathetic (sns)
    - responsible for stimulation of body's fight or flight response
    - constantly active at a basic level to maintain homeostasis
  - parasympathetic nervous system (psns)
    - responsible for stimulation of "rest-and-digest" or "feed and breed" activities 
    - activated when the body is at rest
      - especially after eating
      - this includes sexual arousal, salivation, lacrimation (tears), urination, digestion, and defecation
  - enteric nervous system
    - responsible for the function of the gastrointestinal tract
    - capable of acting independently of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems
      - although it may be influenced by them

- terms origin
  - sympathetic: etymology: syn- "together" + pathos "feeling"
  - para: beside, altered

- vagus nerve (блуждающий нерв)
  - also known as the tenth cranial nerve, cranial nerve X, or simply CN X, 
  - is a cranial nerve that interfaces with the parasympathetic control of the heart, lungs, and digestive tract


## artificial fertilization

- two main types (see [^4] for more)
  - in vitro fertilisation
  - surrogacy 

- in vitro fertilisation (IVF) 
  - alt: экстракорпоральное оплодотворение, эко
  - is a process of fertilisation where an egg is combined with sperm outside the body, in vitro ("in glass")
  - modern approach
    - trophectoderm embryo biopsy is performed on day 5, 6 or 7 following the egg retrieval
      - cells are taken from the part of embryo that becomes a placenta
    - cells are analysed using modern dna sequencing techniques
    - ovarian follicle dominance 
      - is the process where one or more follicles are selected per cycle to ovulate
    - suppression of follicle dominance using hormonal treatment gives many egg cells instead of just one

- gestational surrogates 
  - alt: гестационный курьер, "gestational carriers", "host surrogates", "straight surrogates", "classic surrogates"
  - traditional surrogates are also referred to as 

- embryo preservation
  - its better to freeze embryos than oocytes when woman is certain about her partner
    - better cryoconservation survival rates
  - preservation: no theoretical limit, but in practice - several decades confirmed as of today

- interrupted pregnancy
  - analysis of tissues of aborted/miscarriage fetuses allows to better understand potential reasons of anomaly

- de novo mutation
  - genetic alteration that is present for the first time in one family member as a result of a variant (or mutation) 
    in a germ cell (egg or sperm) of one of the parents, or a variant that arises in the fertilized egg itself 
    during early embryogenesis
  - also called de novo variant, new mutation, and new variant
  
- mutation screening
  - allows detecting unwanted mutations by dna analysis of both partners

- genomic imprinting [^3]
  - is a form of epigenetic inheritance whereby the regulation of a gene or chromosomal region 
    is dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent
  - during gametogenesis, imprinted regions of DNA are differentially marked in accordance to the sex of the parent, 
    resulting in parent-specific expression
  - erasure of the preceding generation’s imprint occurs in the germ line, followed by imprint reestablishment, 
    in accordance with the sex of the organism. Each step in this imprinting process requires epigenetic marks 
    to be interpreted by the genome and acted upon accordingly to result in parent-specific gene expression
  - is likely not influenced by an organism of a surrogate mother, as imprinting happens at earlier stages

- ethical aspects
  - surrogate mother can't be a donor of an egg cell
    - woman rights are getting infringed
    - unethiocal to limit access to a child containing her genetic material
  - surrogate mother has a right to leave child to herself, even if embryo has no genetic material of hers

- genetic pathologies
  - recessive and dominant

- relatively low probability of hiv being passed to a child, when clinic is informed about condition


## vision

- to register light, human eye's cell has to catch 9 photons within 100 milliseconds
  - 750 light years is enough to stop seeing light from a sun


## history

- humorism
  - people: hippocrates, alcmaeon, galen
  - 4 vital body fluids:  
    - blood: air, mixture of 3 others
    - phlegm: water, pus, mucus, saliva, sweat, semen, brain tissue
    - yellow bile: fire, gallbladder
    - black bile: earth, spleen
  - extreme excess or deficiency of any of the humors (bodily fluid) in a person can be a sign of illness
  - moderate imbalance in the mixture of these fluids produces behavioral patterns
  - term 'temperament' came to refer just to psychological dispositions
    - sanguine, choleric, melancholic and phlegmatic signified specific combination of the fluids
  - techniques to cure diseases: purging, bloodletting, catharsis, diuresis, etc.
