  - is the use of figurative language, via word, phrase or an image, for artistic effect such as using a figure of speech
  - a substitution of a word or phrase by a less literal word or phrase
  - also used for describing commonly recurring literary and rhetorical devices, motifs or clichés in creative works

- simile (симили, сравнение)
  - a figure of speech in which two essentially unlike things are compared
    - often in a phrase introduced by "like" or "as"
  - example: she is as innocent as an angel

- metaphor
  - is a figure of speech in which a word or phrase that ordinarily designates one thing is used to designate another
  - while a simile says A is like B, a metaphor says A is B 
  - example: 
    - "she is an angel"
    - refractory lens of an esthetic concept

- analogy
  - is a similarity between like features of two (otherwise dissimilar) things, on which a comparison may be based
