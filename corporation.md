# notes about opening and maintaining corporation in canada

## basics

- corporation can be registered on provincial as well as on federal level
  - provincial registration does not require federal
  - federal requires at least one provincial registration

- as a shareholder of your corporation, you have limited liability. This means that 
  you and the other shareholders are not responsible for the corporation's debts

## paying yourself

- salary
  - personal income that you can show to get a loan
  - enabled rrsp contributions
  - is a tax deduction for corporation 

- dividends
  

## maintanance [^1]

- a company must file an annual report each year within two months after each anniversary 
  of the date on which the company was recognized. A recognition date is the companyâ€™s date of 
  incorporation, amalgamation or continuation into the province.


## taxes

- corporate income that is eligible for the small business rate (generally for income under $500,000) 
  is taxable at between 9% and 14% [^3]

- combined corporate and personal tax payable on a dividend is similar to the personal tax payable on salary [^3]
  - you may benefit from tax-deferred growth if you invest your corporate money

- you can deduct expenses for the business use of a workspace in your home if this 
  is your principal place of business [^2]

- it makes sense to leave as much money as possible in the corporation to benefit from tax-deferred growth

- draw sufficient compensation to use the lower tax brackets or what is needed for living expenses, 
  whichever is higher, and perhaps extra to maximize your TFSA, RESP and possibly RRSPs. But then 
  leave the rest in the corporation
