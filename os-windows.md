# notes related to windows os


## windows 11

- first impressions
  - its scary to see how many glitches this os has
  - some windows are rendered blurry on my secondary monitor
  - while resizing 'windows terminal' app window, blinking white stripes appear
  - on a first startup windows were rendered broken
    - as some drivers installations were changing resolution in background
  - during installation hotkeys were not available to choose right value from long combo-boxes
    - so i had to scroll throgh the whole thing
  - explorer process crashes/restarts regularily
  - my secondary keyboard layout was selected by default after reboot despite it was last in priority list
  - app updates and systems updates are two different things
    - while updates are happenning in a background, your app process may just be killed without your permission
  - hyper-v virtual machine has a way to select from preconfigured linux ubuntu distributives, but
    - ubuntu interface is lagging
    - was hanging with black screen several times during installation, so had to hard reset vm
  - system tray was renamed to "taskbar corner" which is weird
    - it also no longer support option for always showing all tray icons, you need to enable each icon manually
