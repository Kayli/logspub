# self-learning course notes about semiotics

- sign
  - is anything that communicates a meaning that is not the sign itself to the interpreter of the sign
  - can be framed as alienated fragment of reality
    - certain fragments of reality "cool down" or "crystallize" (analogies) to a degree when they 
      are functionally different from the signified
  - categories
    - icon
      - physical resemblance to the signified, the thing being represented
      - example: photograph, movie?
      - 4 types
        - resemblance icons
          - depict direct likenesses of the objects they represent (camera icon for a smartphone camera app)
        - exemplar icons 
          - depict a common example of the class of objects they represent (trowel or rake to represent gardening)
        - symbolic icons 
          - convey a concept at a higher level of abstraction than the object depicted (cracked wineglass to indicate something is fragile)
        - arbitrary icons 
          - have no relationship to an object or concept and their association must be learned (computer on/off power button)
          - hmm, but how they are different from symbols?
    - index
      - shows evidence of whatâ€™s being represented
      - examples 
        - image of smoke (to indicate a fire) - todo: double-check, sounds a bit fishy!!!!
    - symbol
      - has no resemblance between the signifier and the signified
      - the connection between them must be culturally learned
      - examples
        - numbers and alphabets


- different schools of thought that focus on semiotic elements 
  - dyadic (Saussure)
    - sign and signified
  - triadic (Peirce)
    - sign, signified, interpreter
  - quadratic (John Searle)
    - sign, signified, prolocutor (encoder, sender), interpreter (decoder, receiver)
