# lecture notes on basic rocket science

## basics

- liquid oxygen
  - abbreviated LOx, LOX or Lox 
  - in the aerospace, submarine and gas industries is the liquid form of molecular oxygen

- most common propellants
  - liquid oxygene plus
    - highly refined kerosene RP-1
      - atlas v, falcon 9, falcon heavy, soyuz, zenit
    - liquid hydrogen
      - centaur, delta iv, h-iia rocket, european ariane 5, space launch system
    - liquid methane
      - vulcan, new glenn, and spacex starship
      - 3.5/1 mass ratio of oxygene to fuel
      - lowest cost fuel

- heatshields
  - help with decelleration while entering the atmosphere [^1]

- retrorocket [^2]
  - is a rocket engine providing thrust opposing the motion of a vehicle, thereby causing it to decelerate
  - short for retrograde rocket

- typical engines thrusts
  - boeing 747-400
    - thrust 0.25 mn per engine with 4 turbine engines
  - falcon 9 booster 
    - thrust 0.48-0.84 mn with 9 merlin 1 engines 
    - total thrust 7.6 mn sl
  - falcon heavy
    - thrust 0.85 mn per engine with 9 merlin 1d engines per booster with 3 first stages
      - 2 boosters and 1 central core
    - total thrust 15.2 mn sl
  - energia
    - rd0120 core stage  5.8 mn sl + 4 rd170 boosters x 7.25 mn sl
    - total thrust 34.8 mn sl
  - starship
    - thrust 0.88â€“2.21 mn per engine with 29-32 raptor engines
    - total thrust 74 mn sl
      - not all thrusters enabled all the time 
      - thrusters may not be working at their full capacity


## costs

- delivery costs to
  - orbit or space: $2,720 per kilogram (since falcon 9 rocket)
    - iss: $80,000 per kilogram (dragon capsule) [^5]
  - moon:
    - orbit $300,000/kg
    - lunar surface $1,200,000/kg
    - deploying a rover $2,000,000/kg [^6] (2018) 
    - $80,000 per kilogram [^4]
  - mars: about 1 billion dollars per ton, $1m per kg [^3]

As of 2018, payload delivery to lunar orbit is 

## engines

- merlin 1D
  - powers the falcon 9 and falcon heavy launch vehicles
  - the rp-1 and liquid oxygen ("kerolox") used in spacex's prior merlin and kestrel rocket engines
- raptor
  - powered by cryogenic liquid methane and liquid oxygen ("methalox")


## rockets

- starship
  - fully-reusable and super heavy-lift launch vehicle in development by SpaceX
  - has 2 stages: 
    - super heavy booster 
      - 33 raptor engines 
    - and starship spacecraft
      - 6 engines: 3 raptor vacuum and 3 sea-level
  - both stages use liquid oxygen and liquid methane as propellant


## history

- konstantin tsiolkovsky
  - championed the idea of the diversity of life in the universe
  - was the first theorist and advocate of human spaceflight
  - developed a rigorous theory of rocket propulsion in 1896
  - believed in a cosmic being that governed humans as marionettes, mechanical puppets, machines, movie characters
  - wrote a few works on ethics, espousing negative utilitarianism

- robert goddard
  - was an american engineer, professor, physicist, and inventor
  - created the world's first liquid-fueled rocket
  - successfully launched his rocket on March 16, 1926



## abbreviations

- mn: mega newton
- sl: sea level
