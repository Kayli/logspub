# cognitive biases and releated information [^1]

- additive bias
  - e.g. individuals could add or subtract items on a travel itinerary for the optimal experience
    across all experiments, the vast majority of participants chose addition over subtraction
    out of 94 participants who completed the grid task, 73 added squares, 18 subtracted 
    squares and another three simply reworked the original number of squares

- agent detection
  - inclination for animals, including humans, to presume the purposeful intervention of a 
    sentient or intelligent agent in situations that may or may not involve on
  - если вам говорят что никаких агентов не существует, это вовсе не означает что их там нет
    - может использоваться как пси-барьер за котрый нельзя выходить когнитивным процессам жертвы
      по аналогии со стенками клетки (body cell, mind prison cell, similar analogies)
  - some scientists believe that the belief in creator gods is an evolutionary by-product of agent detection

- ты заболел
  - патологизация - инструмент контроля рабов мычащих не в такт
  
- ambiguity effect
  - decision making is affected by a lack of information, or "ambiguity"
  - people tend to select options for which the probability of a favorable outcome is known, 
    over an option for which the probability of a favorable outcome is unknown
  - a risk-averse investor might tend to put their money into "safe" investments such as government bonds 
    and bank deposits, as opposed to more volatile investments such as stocks and funds. Even though the 
    stock market is likely to provide a significantly higher return over time, the investor might prefer 
    the "safe" investment in which the return is known, instead of the less predictable stock market in 
    which the return is not known

- clustering illusion
  - when presented with large amounts of confounding variables, people still tend to claim knowledge 
    of the unknowable this produces cognitive dissonance which when avoided leads people to try to change 
    venues to something with more certainty

- anchoring effect
  - cognitive bias whereby an individual's decisions are influenced by a particular reference point or 'anchor'
  - once the value of the anchor is set, subsequent arguments, estimates, etc. made by an individual may change 
    from what they would have otherwise been without the anchor
  - for example, an individual may be more likely to purchase a car if it is placed alongside 
    a more expensive model (anchor)
