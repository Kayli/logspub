# notes on terminology used in aerospace industry [1]

- airworthiness
  - fitness of an aircraft for flight in all the environments and circumstances 
    - for which it has been designed 
    - and to which it may therefore be exposed
  - an airworthy aeroplane is one which is fit to fly

- ETOPS (/iːˈtɒps/)
  - is an acronym for extended-range twin-engine operations performance standards
  - special part of flight rules for one-engine-inoperative flight conditions

- type certificate (TC)
  - signifies the airworthiness of a particular category of aircraft
    - according to its manufacturing design (type design)
  - issued by a regulatory authority, like
    - u.s. federal aviation administration (faa)
    - the european aviation safety agency (easa)
    - transport canada

- certificate of airworthiness (CoA)
  - is issued for each aircraft that  
    - is properly registered 
    - if it conforms to its type design
    - ready for safe operation

- aircraft condition monitoring system (ACMS)
  - is a predictive maintenance tool
  - consists of
    - high capacity flight data acquisition unit
    - associated sensors
  - sample, monitor, and record, information and flight parameters from significant aircraft systems and components

- non volatile memory (NVM)
  - is the name given to the ‘flash’ RAM found in many items of solid state avionic equipment fitted to modern aircraft. ‘Non Volatile’ means that, subject to memory capacity, stored data is retained when electrical power is removed

- terrain avoidance and warning system (TAWS)
  - provides the flightcrew with sufficient information and alerting to detect a potentially hazardous terrain situation and so the flightcrew may take effective action to prevent a CFIT event

- situational awareness (SA)
  - means appreciating all you need to know about what is going on when the full scope of your task - flying, controlling or maintaining an aircraft - is taken into account

- controlled flight into terrain (CFIT)
  - occurs when an airworthy aircraft under the complete control of the pilot is inadvertently flown into terrain, water, or an obstacle
  - pilots are generally unaware of the danger until it is too late
  - most CFIT accidents occur in the approach and landing phase of flight and are often associated with non-precision approaches.
  - many CFIT accidents occur because of loss of situational awareness

- aircraft maintenance, repair & overhaul/operations (MRO)
  - repair shop/station

- no fault found (NFF)
  - is a standard term used in aviation
  - typically happens when
    - a part removed from an aircraft, due to poor performance
    - is sent to an MRO repair shop for testing 
    - the repair shop cannot replicate or find the problem

- in-flight entertainment (IFE)
  - entertainment available to aircraft passengers during a flight

- fly-by-wire (FBW)
  - system that replaces the conventional manual flight controls of an aircraft with an electronic interface
  - fly-by-wire systems interpret the pilot's control inputs as a desired outcome and calculate the control surface positions required to achieve that outcome; this results in various combinations of rudder, elevator, aileron, flaps and engine controls in different situations using a closed feedback loop
  - fly-by-wire computers act to stabilize the aircraft and adjust the flying characteristics without the pilot's involvement, and to prevent the pilot from operating outside of the aircraft's safe performance envelope
