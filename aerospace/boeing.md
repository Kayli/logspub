    - fda fined boeing for exerting "undue pressure" on its designated aircraft inspectors
    - address design flaw involving the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS)
      - specifically, false input from the angle of attack (AoA) sensor
      - control law, a few lines of software code in the FCC, could autonomously command nosedives, when even a single sensor failure resulted in bad data; MCAS was omitted from aircraft manuals and training, therefore flight crews had no knowledge of its existence or functioning
  - politics
    - republican congressman sam graves at the house aviation subcommittee hearing, blamed the 737 max crashes on poor training of the indonesian and ethiopian pilots; he stated that "pilots trained in the u.s. would have been successful" in handling the emergencies on both jets
