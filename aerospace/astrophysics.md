## universe

- observable (local) universe
  - is a ball-shaped region of the universe comprising all matter that can be observed from earth
  - diameter 93 giga light years
  - mass of ordinary matter 1.5×10^53
  - age 13.77 byo
  - number of particles: 3.28 x 10^80

- composition
  - not well studied
    - 68.3% dark energy
    - 26.8% dark matter
  - ~5% well studied stuff
    - 4%    hydrogen and helium
    - 0.57% stars
    - 0.3%  neutrino
    - 0.03% heavy elements (heavier than hydrogen and helium??)
    - overall density 
      - very low
      - roughly 4.5 × 10−31 grams per cubic centimetre
      - corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four cubic metres of volume
  - composition 13.7 billion years ago (when universe was only 380k years old)
    - neutrinos 10%, photons 15%, atoms 12%, dark matter 63%
  - dark energy has been present for at least 9 billion years and during the period preceding cosmic acceleration
  - started accelerated expansion only about 6 bill years ago
  - 98% of all atoms in the universe are hydrogen and helium [7]

- size
  - most likely infinite
    - to register light, human eye's cell has to catch 9 photons within 100 milliseconds
      - 750 light years is enough to stop seeing light from a sun
      - may be one of the reasons why sky is not infinitely bright?

    - taking into account accelerated expansion
  - but there is more

## planetary systems

- body types
  
  - star 
    - spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity
  
  - planet
      - orbits the star
      - massive enough to be in hydrostatic equilibrium (effectively meaning a spheroid) 
      - giants
        - alt names: outer planets, jovian planets
        - two types
          - gass giants
            - giant planet composed mainly of hydrogen and helium
                - contain the same basic elements as a star
                  - sometimes known as 'failed stars' because of thats
            - examples: jupiter and saturn
          - ice giants
            - examples: uranus, neptune
      - terrestrial planets
        - alt names: telluric planet, rocky planet, inner planet
        - composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals
        - within the Solar System, the terrestrial planets accepted by the IAU are the inner planets closest to the Sun
        - solar system planets: earth, venus, mars, mercury, pluto

  - moon
    - alt name: satellite, natural satellite
    - astronomical body that orbits a planet or minor planet
    - planetary-mass moon 
      - is a planetary-mass object that is also a natural satellite

      - achieve hydrostatic equilibrium (symmetrically rounded in our case)
      - form an ellipsoidal shape
    - sun dwarf planets
      - pluto

  - comet
      - a body of ice, rock and dust that can be several miles in diameter and orbits the sun
      - debris from comets is the source of many meteoroids
      - made up of ice, dust, rocky materials and organic compounds
      - when comets get closer to the Sun, they lose material with each orbit because some of their ice melts and vaporizes

  - asteroid
    - an object larger than a meteoroid that orbits the sun and is made of rock or metal
    - historically, objects larger than 10 meters across have been called asteroids
    - asteroids typically remain solid, even when near the Sun

  - meteoroid
    - a small rocky or metal object that orbits the sun
    - usually between the size of a grain of sand and a boulder
      - boulders size starts approx at 256 millimetres (10.1 in) in diameter
    - it originates from a comet or asteroid

  - meteor
    -  meteoroid that enters the earth’s atmosphere and vaporizes

  - meteorite
    - meteoroid that hits Earth without burning up in the atmosphere
  

## lagrange points [4] [5]

- there are 5 points, only 2 of which are stable
- they are points in a special case solution of a particular 3 body problem
  - two bodies are usually a planet and its natural satelite
  - third body is usually an artificial satellite, obviously significantly lighter than other two bodies
    - this is how you may have a relatively stable solution

- there are 5 points
  - first 3 discovered by euler
  - last 2 discovered by lagrange, are the most stable ones

- sun-earth example
  - l1: between earth and the sun, inside earth orbit
  - l2: same distance from earth as l1, but outside its orbit
    - shielded from the sun by earth
    - this is where james web telescope operates
  - l3: never seen directly from earth
  - l4, l5: most stable, as small deviations from the orbit are self-corrected
    - a bunch of asteroids hanging out there

## extraterrestial life

- drake equation

  - second? most-famous equation in science

- oxygen can start to accumulate in the atmosphere of a planet by the action of ultraviolet light [6]
  - uv divides the co2 in the atmosphere into co and o2
  - hydrogen escapes into space, because it is lighter, leaving oxygen behind
  - this means that carbon life is not the only way to produce oxygen


## questions

## measurements
