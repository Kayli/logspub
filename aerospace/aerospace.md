# notes related to aerospace industry

## basics

- industry
  - largest in terms of monetary value of product output and employment
  - is characterized by
    - relatively small number of large firms
    - numerous international partnerships at every level
  - usa possesses the world’s largest aerospace industrial complex
    - under half of the global aerospace industry (2017)

- aerodynamics
  - branch of dynamics
  - deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion
    - such as an aircraft


## history

- important dates and people
  - 5bc:   mozi and lu ban inventing first kites
  - 880s:  abbas ibn firnas experimented with the flight
  - 1480s: leonardo da vinci's first drawings of flying machines
  - 1800s: george cayley, otto lilienthal working on gliders
  - 1903:  wright brothers first powered, sustained, and controlled airplane flight


## flight vehicles

- lighter-than-air craft
  - balloon (воздушный шар)
  - airship (дирижабль)

- heavier-than-air craft
  - unpowered gliders (sailplanes)
  - uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs)
  - airplane
    - fixed-wing aircraft
    - propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller, or rocket engine
  - rotary-wing (rotorcraft): helicopter and others
  - flapping-wing: ornithopter
  - rockets and missiles
  - space launch vehicles
  - spacecraft (crewed and uncrewed)

- purpose
  - airliner: is a type of aircraft for transporting passengers and air cargo in commercial service
  - military: combat or non-combat

- major flight-vehicle subsystems 
  - propulsion
  - avionics (aviation electronics)

- key support systems
  - testing, operation, and maintenance of flight vehicles


## airplanes

- key characteristics
  - passenger capacity
  - fuel consumption
  - range
  - speed
  - co2 emissions
  - noise
  - safety features
  - operating costs
  - in-flight entertainment (ife) features

- most popular commercial airplanes
  - airbus a380
  - boeing 727, 747-400

- main flight control surfaces
  - ailerons (рули крена, элероны): roll
  - elevators (руль высоты́): pitch, horizontal axis
  - rudder (руль направления): yaw, vertical axis

- yoke (control wheel or a control column)
  - is a device used for piloting some fixed-wing aircraft
  - pilot uses the yoke to control the attitude of the plane, usually in both pitch and roll
    - rotating the control wheel controls the ailerons and the roll axis
    - fore and aft movement of the control column controls the elevator and the pitch axis
      - when the yoke is pulled back, the nose of the aircraft rises
      - when the yoke is pushed forward, the nose is lowered

- skin of an aircraft
  - is the outer surface which covers much of its wings and fuselage
  - most commonly used materials are aluminum and aluminium alloys


## countries and companies

- canada
  - bombardier
    - regional airliners (e.g. dash 8 series 400)
    - business jets (global express, challenger)
  - canadian space agency (csa)

- usa (top 5 aerospace and defense companies)
  - spacex
  - lockheed martin
  - raytheon (rtx) technologies
  - boeing
  - general dynamics
  - northrop grumman

- europe
  - airbus
  - ariane family of space launch vehicles

- russia
  - roskosmos
    - r-7 rocket (союз)

- china: china cssc holdings

- india: airnetz aviation


## typical lifecycle of commercial plane

- design
  - has to meet the applicable certification code
  - often seeks to improve the aircraft’s economics (cost benefit) to both the manufacturer and the operator
- test and certification
  - normally a few prototypes are built, each subject to different tests
  - passes type certification 
  - prototypes serve as a template for serial aircraft production
- production
- delivery
- operational service
- retirement: decomissioning and recycling


## flight data recorders

- commercial airlines often use two types of flight recorders 
  - a flight data recorder (FDR)
  - cockpit voice recorder (CVR)

- many other systems of the aircraft are equipped with non volatile memory (NVM) from which data can be also recovered

- both FDR and CVR equipment must be crash protected under EASA CS 25 and FAA Part 25

- flight data recorder basics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYvYlQme96g

- boeing specific [2]
  - airplane health management (AHM)
  - primary source of the data
    - for the 747-400 and 777: airplane’s central maintenance computer (CMC)
    - other models: airplane condition monitoring systems (ACMS)
  - AHM also collects electronic logbook data from the Boeing Electronic Flight Bag
  - data is collected and downlinked via the airplane communication addressing and reporting system
  - data received in real-time directly from airplanes is hosted by Boeing within the MyBoeingFleet.com Web portal. If an issue is detected, alerts and notifications are automatically sent to a location specified by the airline via fax, personal digital assistant, e-mail, or pager. Maintenance personnel can then access complete AHM information about the issue through an application service provider tool and reports on MyBoeingFleet.com


## aerodynamics

- air properties
  - density
  - pressure
  - temperature
  - humidity
  - viscosity

- international standard atmosphere (isa)

- mach number
  - fraction/multiplier of a speed of sound in a medium for local conditions
  - e.g. 'mach 2' means 2 times speed of sound
  - depends on
    - temperature
    - atmospheric density/altitude
  - speed of sound at sea level is about 340 m/s

- flight envelope (also service envelope, or performance envelope)
  - applied to an aircraft or spacecraft
  - refers to the capabilities of a design in terms of 
    - airspeed
    - altitude (sometimes unpacked as load factor or atmospheric density)
  - pushing the envelope
    - when aircraft being taken to or beyond its designated altitude and speed limits
    - for instance by diving it at high speeds, it is said to be flown "outside the envelope"
      - something considered rather dangerous
  - may refer more generally to the predictable behavior of a given phenomenon or situation, and hence, its "flight envelope"

- stall speed
  - fixed-wing aircraft have a minimum speed at which they can maintain level flight

- service ceiling
  - maximum altitude
  - additional speed will not result in increased altitude
  - zero rate of climb
    - is caused by the lift of the aircraft getting smaller at higher altitudes, until it no longer exceeds gravity
    - caused by lower atmospheric density at higher altitudes

- top speed
  - power needed varies almost linearly with altitude
  - but nature of drag means that it varies with the square of speed
