# notes about software management and related topics

## basics

- non-technical software managers are evil
  - software manager should be able to understand/help in solving technical problems
    - otherwise its a 'box ticker' or 'taskmaster' antipattern [^1]
    - can easily be tricked/manipulated by its fellow team members

- bus factor
  - minimum number of team members that have to suddenly disappear from a project before 
    the project stalls due to lack of knowledgeable or competent personnel


## communication

- face-to-face conversations
- pair programming
- joint design sessions
- meetings
- information radiators


## disfunctions

- job security, leading to pathological tendencies in a long run
  - "professional IT engineers" ending up doing same things over and over again thousand times

- many current engineering approaches not optimized for culture of hedonism but 
  - for culture of dominance through pain
  - it is a pain to spend your life on monkey-job trifles, better spend it with your loved ones
  - our bodies (intuition, subconsciousness) are saying: something is wrong here, however we keep ignoring these signals
  - for culture of elitism where on the top is a cohort of chosen ones
  - nothing bad about being more experienced than others for short periods of time
  - but culture should stimulate more experienced to share knowledge rather than build walls around it
  - for culture of obscurity for the sake of job security
  - obscurity (e.g. spaghetti code) in this case should be viewed as an emergent process, not something done intentionally
    - however, malignant intent should not be taken out from consideration completely
    - gives short term benefits (local extremum)
    - engineers need non-trivial extra effort to avoid it

- managerial feudalism [^2]
  - hunt for power for its own sake


## microagressions

- todo: lookup videos on microagressions, passive agressive behaviors


## planning

- agile
- evidence-based scheduling by Joel Spolsky [^5]


## risks management

- sales or non-technical managers can make your life miserable by
  - making promises to customers without checking with you
  - pestering you to deliver on unrealistic time lines etc
  - posting bug reports that are unnecessary 


## law

- in canada there are statutory termination requirements when terminating someone without cause, 
  but there are also Common Law rights to “Due Notice”: time to find another job without loss of income.
  Just meeting the statutory requirements can result in a Wrongful Dismissal lawsuit, so it is best to 
  put together a package that you think the person will find acceptable from the outset rather than have 
  them running to a lawyer [^3]

- statutory vs. common law termination notice [^4]


## common reasons for leaving [^6]

- people report being constantly stressed out
  - too many hats to wear
  - too many responsibilities and they cant be the best in any one of them
- primary reason why people leave companies
  - 12% because of their manager 
  - 28% because of leadership
  - 52% development opportunities

- эффективно делегировать полномочия сотрудникам
- применять мотиваторы для сотрудников
