# notes about software management and related topics

## basics

- non-technical software managers are evil
  - software manager should be able to understand/help in solving technical problems
    - otherwise its a 'box ticker' or 'taskmaster' antipattern [^1]
    - can easily be tricked/manipulated by its fellow team members


## communication

- face-to-face conversations
- pair programming
- joint design sessions
- meetings
- information radiators


## disfunctions

- job security, leading to pathological tendencies in the long run
  - "professional IT engineers" ending up doing same things over and over again thousand times

- many current engineering approaches not optimized for culture of hedonism but 
  - for culture of dominance through pain
  - it is a pain to spend your life on monkey-job trifles, better spend it with your loved ones
  - our bodies (intuition, subconsciousness) are saying: something is wrong here, however we keep ignoring these signals
  - for culture of elitism where on the top is a cohort of chosen ones
  - nothing bad about being more experienced than others for short periods of time
  - but culture should stimulate more experienced to share knowledge rather than build walls around it
  - for culture of obscurity for the sake of job security
  - obscurity (e.g. spaghetti code) in this case should be viewed as an emergent process, not something done intentionally
    - however, malignant intent should not be taken out from consideration completely
    - gives short term benefits (local extremum)
    - engineers need non-trivial extra effort to avoid it

- managerial feudalism [^2]
  - hunt for power for its own sake
