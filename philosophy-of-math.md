# notes on the topic of philosophy of math

- david hilbert (1862–1943) holds that mathematics is only a language and a series of games
  - "... and to what extent has the formula game thus made possible been successful? This formula game 
    enables us to express the entire thought-content of the science of mathematics in a uniform manner and 
    develop it in such a way that, at the same time, the interconnections between the individual propositions
    and facts become clear" [^1][^2]

- reverse mathematics
  - program in mathematical logic that seeks to determine which axioms are required to prove theorems of mathematics 
  - can briefly be described as "going backwards from the theorems to the axioms", 
    - in contrast to the ordinary mathematical practice of deriving theorems from axioms
  - can be conceptualized as sculpting out necessary conditions from sufficient ones

- formalization of mathematics
  - peano axioms (dedekind–peano axioms, peano postulates) 
    - are 9 axioms for the natural numbers presented by the 19th century Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano
    - formulated in a language of set theory
    - helped answering questions of whether number theory is consistent and complete
