# notes on the topic of philosophy of math

- david hilbert (1862â€“1943) holds that mathematics is only a language and a series of games
  - "... and to what extent has the formula game thus made possible been successful? This formula game 
    enables us to express the entire thought-content of the science of mathematics in a uniform manner and 
    develop it in such a way that, at the same time, the interconnections between the individual propositions
    and facts become clear" [^1][^2]
