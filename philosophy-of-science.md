# self learning course notes on philosophy of physical sciences

- scientific realism
  - goal is to uncover objective truth about the world around us
    - therefore progress occurs when theories more accurately represent facts
  - objective epistemic basis for evaluating scientific disagreements
  - positive epistemic attitude toward the content of our best theories and models
    - recommending belief in both observable and unobservable aspects of the world described by the sciences
  - goal of progress usually valued higher than social coherence
  - inductive reasoning method
    - the premises are viewed as supplying some evidence
    - but they don't offer full assurance of the truth of the conclusion
    - one's experiences and observations, including what are learned from others, are synthesized to come up with a general truth
    - difference from deductive reasoning
      - conclusion of a deductive argument is certain
      - but the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is probable, based upon the evidence given
  - inductivism
    - make observations about the world
    - draw inductive inferences about the way the world is
      - such inferences are fallible but nonetheless rational 
  - scientific method is an inductive method 

- falsifiability
  - karl popper
  - argued for falsifiability
    - as one of the necessary criteria in verification game of science
  - premises and conclusions(expected behavior) should be verifiable
    - ideally, testing procedure should be offered (described)
  - opposed this to the intuitively similar concept of verifiability
    - verifying the claim "all swans are white" would require assessment of all swans, which is not possible
    - the single observation of a black swan is sufficient to falsify it
      - its like unit-tests trying to falsify your written program to find 
        - inconsistency between actual and expected behaviors of the system (a bug)
    

- kuhn's rationality of theory choice 
  - book "the structure of scientific revolutions"
  - paradigm shift
    - occurs when enough anomalies are accumulated which are not explainable by current theoretical framework
    - theory that 'wins' must have a higher puzzle-solving power than other alternatives

- conjecture vs hypothesis
  - both of them are statements based on observations, that seem to be true, but have not been proved or disproved yet
  - difference is in level of credibility that explanation is based on
    - hypothesis is testable, and explanation is based on accepted grounds
    - conjecture is proposition based on inconclusive grounds, and sometimes can not be fully tested
  - conjectures, unlike hypothesis, are used in math and hypothesis usualy are used elsewhere
    - if conjecture is proven, it becomes a theorem
    - border between two terms remains blurry, and terms sometimes are used as synonyms
    - 'riemann hypothesis' correctly should be called 'riemann conjecture'
  
- epistemic relativism
  - in a simplest case, there are two contradictary hypotheses
  - and there is no legitimate rational basis to agree about what counts as a good evidence to prefer one over the other
  - example: there is no objective reason to prefer one poem over the other
    - as such preference is highly subjective
  - social coherence usually valued higher than progress


- what is scientific?
  - for example, why "literary theory" is not scientific?
    - valuable and important kind of inquiry
    - yields knowledge
    - verification procedure is significantly modified
      - in comparison to one standardised by modern scientific community
      - no clear validation procedure against reality exists 
        - as even if there is a connection to reality, perception of it is highly subjective
        - meanings are too fluid and crafted to induce multiple equally valid interpretations
      - "prestiege" and "novelty" games are much more important than "verification" game

## random thoughts

- related to following statement
 - verifying the claim "all swans are white" would require assessment of all swans, which is not possible
      - but how about: "all swans that we've encountered in the past are white"?
        - when programming language toolchain emposes parser rules on a user program, entered as a text, it verifies only
          - past(existing) data
          - data passed to it explicitly by user
        - it doens't make any claims about
          - all existing user programs that have ever been entered till this moment
          - data that will be entered in the future
