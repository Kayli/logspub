# self learning course notes on philosophy of physical sciences

- scientific realism
  - goal is to uncover objective truth about the world around us
    - therefore progress occurs when theories more accurately represent facts
  - objective epistemic basis for evaluating scientific disagreements
  - positive epistemic attitude toward the content of our best theories and models
    - recommending belief in both observable and unobservable aspects of the world described by the sciences
  - goal of progress usually valued higher than social coherence
  - inductive reasoning method
    - the premises are viewed as supplying some evidence
    - but they don't offer full assurance of the truth of the conclusion
    - one's experiences and observations, including what are learned from others, are synthesized to come up with a general truth
    - difference from deductive reasoning
      - conclusion of a deductive argument is certain
      - but the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is probable, based upon the evidence given
  - inductivism
    - make observations about the world
    - draw inductive inferences about the way the world is
      - such inferences are fallible but nonetheless rational 
  - scientific method is an inductive method 
  - new organon 1620
    - francis bacon creates a new system of logic he believes to be superior to the old ways of syllogism
      - this is now known as the baconian method
  - principia mathematica 1687
    - isaac newton defines laws of motion

  - calvinism
  - deism
    - god created earth but after that no longer had influence on life and not watching it
    - secularism

- falsifiability
  - karl popper
  - argued for falsifiability
    - as one of the necessary criteria in verification game of science
  - premises and conclusions(expected behavior) should be verifiable
    - ideally, testing procedure should be offered (described)
  - opposed this to the intuitively similar concept of verifiability
    - verifying the claim "all swans are white" would require assessment of all swans, which is not possible
    - the single observation of a black swan is sufficient to falsify it
      - its like unit-tests trying to falsify your written program to find inconsistency between actual and expected behaviors of the system (a bug)

- kuhn's rationality of theory choice 
  - book "the structure of scientific revolutions"
  - paradigm shift
    - occurs when enough anomalies are accumulated which are not explainable by current theoretical framework
    - theory that 'wins' must have a higher puzzle-solving power than other alternatives

- conjecture vs hypothesis
  - both of them are statements based on observations, that seem to be true, but have not been proved or disproved yet
  - difference is in level of credibility that explanation is based on
    - hypothesis is testable, and explanation is based on accepted grounds
    - conjecture is proposition based on inconclusive grounds, and sometimes can not be fully tested
  - conjectures, unlike hypothesis, are used in math and hypothesis usualy are used elsewhere
    - if conjecture is proven, it becomes a theorem
    - border between two terms remains blurry, and terms sometimes are used as synonyms
    - 'riemann hypothesis' correctly should be called 'riemann conjecture'
  
- epistemic relativism
  - in a simplest case, there are two contradictary hypotheses
  - and there is no legitimate rational basis to agree about what counts as a good evidence to prefer one over the other
  - example: there is no objective reason to prefer one poem over the other
    - as such preference is highly subjective
  - social coherence usually valued higher than progress

- what is scientific?
  - for example, why "literary theory" is not scientific?
    - valuable and important kind of inquiry
    - yields knowledge
    - verification procedure is significantly modified
      - in comparison to one standardised by modern scientific community
      - no clear validation procedure against reality exists 
        - as even if there is a connection to reality, perception of it is highly subjective
        - meanings are too fluid and crafted to induce multiple equally valid interpretations
      - "prestiege" and "novelty" games are much more important than "verification" game   

- reduction
  - ontological: complex system is nothing but an aggregation of its simpler components
  - explanatory: complex system can be explained by the theory governing its components alone

- logical empiricism, or positivism
  - which argues that science mathematically coordinates and predicts sense data, rather than seeking underlying metaphysical realities

- process philosopy, ontology of becoming, or processism
  - is an approach to philosophy that identifies processes, changes, or shifting relationships as the only true elements of the ordinary, everyday real world. It treats other real elements (examples: enduring physical objects, thoughts) as abstractions from, or ontological dependents on, processes
  - has some parallels with 'event sourcing' approach in software design

- underdetermination thesis of theory by data
  - all evidence necessarily underdetermines any scientific theory
  - example
    - if all that was known was that exactly $10 was spent on apples and oranges, and that apples cost $1 and oranges $2, then one would know enough to eliminate some possibilities (e.g., 6 oranges could not have been purchased), but one would not have enough evidence to know which specific combination of apples and oranges was purchased

- duhemâ€“quine thesis
  - posits that it is impossible to experimentally test a scientific hypothesis in isolation
    - because an empirical test of the hypothesis requires one or more background assumptions 
      - also called auxiliary assumptions or auxiliary hypotheses
      - similar to godel's incompleteness theorem ???
  - unambiguous scientific falsifications are impossible
  - related thesis: bundle of hypotheses
    - as a whole can be tested against the empirical world and be falsified if it fails the test
    - impossible to isolate a single hypothesis in the bundle ('confirmation holism' viewpoint)

## random thoughts

- related to following statement
 - verifying the claim "all swans are white" would require assessment of all swans, which is not possible
      - but how about: "all swans that we've encountered in the past are white"?
        - when programming language toolchain emposes parser rules on a user program, entered as a text, it verifies only
          - past(existing) data
          - data passed to it explicitly by user
        - it doens't make any claims about
          - all existing user programs that have ever been entered till this moment
          - data that will be entered in the future
