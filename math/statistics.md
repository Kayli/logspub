# notes on statistics

## basics

- attribute
  - is a quality (characteristic, aspect) of an object (person, thing, etc.)
  - can be viewed as a "quality that we measure"

- variable
  - variable is the operationalized way in which the attribute is represented for further data processing
  - values of each variable statistically "vary" (or are distributed) across the variable's domain
  - can be viewed as a set of measurements of a specific attibute
  - often represented as a column in a data table

- domain
  - set of all possible values that a variable is allowed to have

- null hypothesis
  - usually, the null hypothesis is a statement of 'no effect' or 'no difference'
  - for two variables a and b, means that the mean of a is the same as the mean of b
    - stronger null hypothesis: variance and shape of the distributions are also equal

- heterogeneity
  - populations, samples or results are different
  - it is the opposite of homogeneity, which means that the population/data/results are the same

- r+1 notation
  - easily composable rate of return
  - has nothing to do with pearson correlation coefficient
  - examples
    - return of 20% equals to 0.2 + 1 = 1.2 
    - return of -5% equals to 0.05 + 1 = -1.05


## data analysis

- two key types of data
  - organic or process datasets
    - most likely generated by computerized information system
    - examples
      - stock market transactions
      - netflix viewing history
      - web browsing activity
  
  - designed datasets
    - sample for data collection is designed
    - datasets are typically much smaller, comparing to organic datasets
    - data collected for very specific reasons
    - examples
      - political preferences survey

- analysing source of data
  - is it iid? 
    - independent observations
      - individual observations are not causally connected
    - identically distributed
      - categorized/normalized in the same manner?
      - counterexamples
        - males and females may have different means
        - students from the same study group tend to have similar scores

- variable types
  - quantitative
    - are numerical, math operations should make sense
    - subgroups
      - continuous
      - discrete
  - qualitative or categorical
    - classifies individual into different groups
    - subgroups
      - ordinal (have an order or ranking)
      - nominal (just names, no ranking)
- data management
  - rectangular datasets (tables)
    - rows represent cases
    - columns represent variables    
  - data layouts
    - long (most common, less columns more rows)
    - wide (used less frequently, more columns less rows)


## tools

- python libraries 
  - commonly used
    - numpy: arrays of data
    - pandas: data structures and analysis tools
    - scipy: numerical and scientific computing
    - matplotlib, seaborn: plotting
    - statsmodels: statistical techniques
  - forecasting
    - prophet
      - procedure for forecasting time series data 
      - based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with seasonality, plus holiday effects
    - greykite
      - exploratory data analysis, outlier/anomaly preprocessing, feature extraction and engineering, 
      - grid search, evaluation, benchmarking, and plotting
  - data
    - wikipedia: python bindings for wikipedia api


## analysis graphical

- graphs
  - pie charts
    - may be harder to represent small-valued variables
  - histograms
    - bins: rectangular-shaped bars representing variables
    - aspects: characteristics of data that can be visualized/seen
      - shape
        - bell-shape, left-skewed, right-skewed, symmetric
        - unimodal, bimodal, multimodal (number of distinct peaks)
      - center
        - median: an area to the left of the median equals to the area to the right
        - mean: simply an average
      
      - spread
        - mean absolute deviation, MAD
        - standard deviation
        - variance
        - interquartile range (iqr)
          - equals to q3-q1 or 1.349 sigma
      - outliers
  - bar charts
    - visually similar to histograms, but for categorical data
  - box plot
    - visualizes: min, q1, median, q3, max, iqr
    - iqr represented by height of a box in the center
    - dots or small circles above and below wiskers represent outliers


## analysis numerical

- numerical summaries
  - min, max
  - 1st quartile or 25th percentile
    - point where 25% of the data falls below this value
  - median: 50th percentile
  - 3rd quartile or 75th percentile
  - iqr=q3-q1 
    - interquartile range
    - is another measure of spread
    - means how spread out middle 50% of our data is

- spread
  - mean absolute deviation, MAD
    - it corresponds to "real life" much better than sd
    - is more accurate in sample measurements
    - less volatile than STD since it is a natural weight whereas standard deviation uses the observation itself as its own weight, imparting large weights to large observations, thus overweighing tail events
    - most natural measure of spread

  - standard deviation
    - alternative names: sd, sigma, среднеквадратичное отклонение
    - variance = 1/N * sum((x - mean)^2)
  - variance 
    - alternative names: sigma^2, дисперсия
    - has the additive property when dealing with random variables [6]
        
- bell shaped distribution
  - empirical rules
    - 68% of the data lies within 1sd from the mean
    - 95% of data lies within 2sd from the mean
    - 99.7% of data lies within 3sd from the mean
  - standard_score = (observed - mean) / sd

- analysing multivariate quantitative data
  - easy to do with scatterplot
  - association type: 
    - linear: pattern is a line
      - positive: linear approximation of a graph gives a positive slope line
      - negative
    - quadratic: pattern is a parabola
  - strength of linear association
    - levels
      - weak: data scattered a lot along the line
      - moderate
      - strong: data follows the line consistently
    - quantifiable by 'pearson correlaion'
      - strength and sign between two variables
  - correlation outliers
    - rare points of data that do not follow correlation pattern


## regression

- point of building a regression model is to understand how changes in a regressor lead to changes in a response variable 
- response (or “regressand”)
  - variable we're trying to predict
- regressor 
  - any variable in a regression model that is used to predict a response variable
  - often referred as 'feature'
- types of linear regression
  - simple: one regressor
  - multiple: multiple regressors


## sequences

- sequence is an ordered list of objects or events
  - orderliness and its origin in such data is arbitrary and can be
    - an artifact of a model
    - for the sake of comfort of an observer (analyst) working with data
  - sequences of events taken in time progression are called time-series
  

## time-series

- definition
  - series of data points indexed or listed or graphed in time order
  - in contrast with sequences, time-series assumes stronger potential for causality
    - especially if points of data (events), is physically colocated or connected by conductive medium
  
- components analysis
  - trend
    - linear approximation
    - simple moving average
    - exponential smoothing
      - smoothing data using the exponential window function
  - seasonality
    - recurring patterns in data
    - deseasonalization of data may help to focus on other components
  - variation
  - error
    - cyclical irregularity
    - patterns in the error component indicate that there is still a room for improvement left in your model
    - common techniques
      - mean absolute deviation (mad) 
      - mean absolute percentage error (mape)
      - mean square error (mse)

- advanced methods of analysis
  - autocorrelation or serial correlation
  - spectral and harmonic analysis
  

## causality analysis [8]

- most lectures focus on
  - applications to healthcare and related studies
  - exposure to a treatment is a common main scenario considered
  - predicting contrafactual (potential) outcomes, considering alternative exposures

- meta-learning [7]
  - learn the learning (or inference/estimation) procedure itself, directly from data
- causal bayesian network
- structural equation modelling

- projects
  - http://dagitty.net allows to draw and analyse causal diagrams


## fallacies

- multiple comparisons problem
  - arise when a statistical analysis involves multiple simultaneous statistical tests, each of which has a potential to produce a "discovery"
  - example: consider the efficacy of a drug in terms of the reduction of any one of a number of disease symptoms. As more symptoms are considered, it becomes increasingly likely that the drug will appear to be an improvement over existing drugs in terms of at least one symptom due to random sampling error alone


## hypothesis testing

- p-value: indicates probability that null hypothesis is true
  - e.g. in drug effects testing there are usually two hypotheses: 'null-hypothesis' is the one that claims drug has no effect, 'alternative hypothesis' claims that it has statistically significant effect
