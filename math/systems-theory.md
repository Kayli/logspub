# notes on systems theory and related topics

## basics

- systems theory
  - interdisciplinary study of systems


- system
  - cohesive group of interrelated, interdependent components that 
  - a group of interacting, interdependent parts that form a complex whole
  - defined in terms of its boundary
  - entities lying outside the system then become part of the system's environment
  - can exhibit properties that produce behaviors which are distinct from the properties and behaviors of its parts
  - parts of the system can be natural or human-made

- dependency
  - scenario in which the nodes in one network require support from nodes in another network
  - allows to identify/avoid cascading failures


## networks

- composite node ("meta-node" or a "supernode")
  - not strictly defined (only defined depending on the specific context and the goals of the analysis)
  - examples of defining composite nodes in network science
    - composite node can be created by aggregating the properties of the nodes within the group, or by defining a new set of connections between the composite node and other nodes in the network.


## chaos theory

- definition
  - is an interdisciplinary area of scientific study and branch of mathematics
  - focused on patterns and deterministic laws of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions

- simplest chaotic systems
  - logistic map
    - is a polynomial mapping (quadratic)
    - is a recurrence relation
    - chaotic at r â‰ˆ 3.56995

  - double-rod pendulum (double pendulum, chaos pendulum)
    - illustrates a simple mechanical system with short prediction horizon
