## book: "qbism: the future of quantum physics" 
- author: Hans Christian von Baeyer
- more recent notes are closer to the top of the document


- probabilities
  - frequentist approach
    - defined as: favorable cases divided by all cases
      - implies that all possible cases are known, state space of possibilities is discrete (quantized?)
    - problems
      - when situation taken to a limit (infinite number of coin tosses) probabilities become certain
        - this approach loses its objectivity as hypothetical and experimentally unverifiable
      - assumes that for example that coin is symmetrical and all coin tosses are absolutely identical for each repetition
        - this is whats usually called 'fair coin toss'
        - doesn't exist in real world

- qubit
  - any quantum system with 2 possible states
  - can be represented by a spin of an electron 
  - mathematically can be described by 2x2 matrix - smallest possible square matrix
  - how is it different from classical 'bit' in information theory
    - it is a real physical quantum mechanical object or system
    - it is a thing, not a symbol
      - remember Alfred Korzybski warning: map is not a territory
  - 'qubit' word will be used as a shorthand for 'qubit wavefunction'
  - point on a sphere can symbolically represent a cubit
    - every point on a surface corresponds to probability
    - poles are labeled 1 and 0
    - phase is measured by an angle and lies orthoganally to poles axis
      - it is considered to be in an imaginary space
    - between two extremes lies superpositions (blends) of two values


         
- universal gravitation as action at the distance
  - contradicts daily intuition that direct interaction transmits forces 
  - miracle masquerading as a law of nature
  - newton assumed
    - existence of an agent responsible for the force of gravity
    - personally believed that gravity is related to god (wtf)
    - presumably has to act immediately on all objects in universe
  - einstein substituted it by principle of local action, bound by speed of light

- double-slit experiment
  - was first performed, using light, by Thomas Young in 1801, as a demonstration of the wave behavior of light
  - was described for electrons as well, but performed only in 2013 due to technical challenges
    - each slit is 60nm wide to enable interference pattern to emerge
  
-  electron, in comparison is 
  - created out of the "electron field"
  - is negatively charged
  - has positron as antiparticle
  
- wave-particle duality of light
  - light is an electromagnetic wave
  - created out of the "electromagnetic field"
  - propagated through space as wave packet, fluctuatiions in electromagnetic field
  - light is neutral, so its not charged, so it has no antiparticle
  
- einstein started working on related problems
  - photoelectric effect
    - photon hits an electron in a metal plate and gives it all its energy
    - electron starts moving around bouncing of nearby atoms and finally leaves its "prison"
  - why there is a minimum frequency below which photoelectric effect stops?
    - if the energy of the photon is too low, it can't push electron out of its atom

- max planck comes up with the model of mathematical oscillators 
  - represented "energy elements" 
  - later was discovered that those elements were actual atoms and molecules
  - scillator can store following quantas of energy: 0, e, 2e, 3e ... 
    - amplitude defines energy being stored (not sure)
    - frequency is how fast energy oscillates
  - planks formula e=hf 
    - h is a plank's constant, adjustable parameter, 6.63E-34 joule-seconds
    - f is a frequency of light wave oscillation
    - e is a total energy of light being emmitted

- light rays of different colors have its own amplitude and frequency
- in 1900 it was already known that light is a wave
