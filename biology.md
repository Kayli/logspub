## evolutionary thories

- divine creation
- darwinism
  - catastrophism
  - mutogenesis
    - main trains of thought
      - lamarckism
      - darwinism
  - modern synthesis
  
- modern ideas
  - continuous vs discrete increments of fenotype
    - continuous (micromutations)
      - degree of expression of certain genes
        - regulatory proteins
          - modify accessibility of binding sites of dna molecule
            - similarities with event-diven systems in software
    - discrete (macromutations)
      - genome is discrete by itself, so not a big surpise here
      - also can be consequence of a quick/sharp resonanse (chemical?)


## symbiotic relationships

- dependence
  - obligate
    - meaning that one or both of the symbionts entirely depend on each other for survival
  - facultative, optional
    - independent organisms, capable surviving on their own, when necessary

- mutualism (interspecies reciprocal altruism)
  - long-term relationship between individuals of different species where both individuals benefit
  
- parasitism
  - parasite benefits while the host is harmed
  
- mimicry
  - species adopts distinct characteristics of another species 
    - to alter its relationship dynamic with the species being mimicked, to its own advantage
    
- endosymbiosis
  - nutritional dependence


- physical attachment
  - conjunctive
    - symbionts form a single body
  - disjunctive 
    - all other arrangements


## anatomy

- anatomy vs physiology
  - anatomy is about statics of an organism: focus on structure
  - physiology is more about dynamics of an organism: its development, metabolism, etc

- hyoid bone (подъязычная кость)
