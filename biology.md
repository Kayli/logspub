# notes on biology and related topics


## basics

- cytology: a study of living cells and their structure, behaviour and function

- histology (microscopic anatomy or microanatomy)
  - a branch of biology which studies the microscopic anatomy of biological tissues


## cells  [^2] 

- cell: basic structural and functional unit of life form

- cell types
  - by structural advancement
    - procaryotes
      - archaea
      - bacteria
    - eucaryotes
      - animalia
      - fungi
      - plantalia
      - protozoa
        - plasmodium
          - malaria
      - others
  - by chromosome set structure
    - haploid: one set of chromosomes
    - diploid
      - two set of chromosomes, a set of chromosome pairs
      - great majority of animal species and about a half of plant species are diploid

- cell division types
  - mitosis
    - cell divides itself into two identical copies
    - diploid set of chromosomes
  - meiosis (reduction division)
    - cell splits into male-female?? pair
    - gametes
      - are an organism's reproductive cells
      - also referred to as sex cells
      - female gametes are called ova or egg cells, and male gametes are called sperm
    - haploid set of chromosomes
    - sexual reproduction
    - synaptonemal complex
      - to stabilize the chromosome pairs, protein links form along the length of the homologs, like a zipper
      - this zipper seems necessary to allow the homologues to break and recombine
        - thereby exchanging a set of genes between Mom and Dad 
        - before sending the chromosomes into the world aboard egg or sperm


## photosynthesis

- process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy 
  - through cellular respiration this energy can later be released to fuel the organism's activities
- chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules
  - sugars and starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water 
  - 6(CO2) + 6(H2O) + light = C6H12O6[sugar] + 6(O2)


## tissues

- definition
  - an ensemble of similar cells and their extracellular matrix from the same origin 
    that together carry out a specific function

- main groups
  - epithelial
    - formed by cells that cover the organ surfaces
    - types
      - simple (однослойный)
      - stratified (многослойный)
        - the most exterior of cells are dead and lose their nucleus and cytoplasm
        - contain a tough, resistant protein called keratin
    - examples: surface of skin, airways, surfaces of soft organs, the reproductive tract, 
      inner lining of the digestive tract
  - connective
    - found in between other tissues everywhere in the body
    - components
      - fibers (elastic and collagen fibers) 
      - ground substance (межклеточное вещество)
      - cells
    - main types
      - liquid connective tissues (blood and lymph)
      - fascia
      - cartilage (хрящи), tendons (сухожилия) and ligaments (связки)
      - bone
        - composition
          - collagen (structural protein), 1/3 of mass
          - phasphates and hydrophasphates of Ca (кальций) and Mg (магний), 2/3 of mass
        - cells: osteocytes
      - fat
        - white
        - brown 
  - muscle
    - skeletal
    - smooth
    - cardiac
  - nervous
    - neurons
    - glial


## organs

- organ is a collection of tissues joined in a structural unit to serve a common function


## organisms

- feeding habit
  - autotrophic: can produce their own food
  - heterotrophic: rely on other organisms for food


## mushrooms

- микромице́ты: микроскопические плодовые тела
- макромицеты: большие плодовые тела
  - симбиозные: питание за счет растений
  - базидиомицеты: утилизируют сложные субстраты как целлюлоза

- микотоксины: защита как от других видов грибов так и от поедающих животных
  - экзотоксины - находятся вне, выделяются микроскопическими грибами типа плесени
  - эндотоксины - находятся внутри тела гриба
    - пептиды: могут действовать как гормоны, нейроактивные в-ва и прочее


## anatomy

- anatomy vs physiology
  - anatomy is about statics of an organism: focus on structure
  - physiology is more about dynamics of an organism: its development, metabolism, etc

- skeleton
  - structural frame that supports animal body
  - types
    - exoskeleton: stable outer shell of an organism
    - endoskeleton: forms the support structure inside the body
    - hydroskeleton: flexible skeleton supported by fluid pressure
  - functions
    - mechanical
    - hematopoietic (blood-forming, кроветворная)
    - metabolic (deposit of minerals like Ca)

- human skeleton
  - there are 205-208 bones in adult, 270 in a newborn, cause some bones merge as development progresses
    - stop growing at age 25 for males, 20 for females

  - red bone marrow (красный костный мозг)
  - marrow adipose tissue (fatty/yellow fraction, желтый костный мозг)
  - bones
    - axial skeleton: bones of the head and trunk
      - head
        - skull (23 bones)
          - neurocranium (мозговой отдел)
          - viscerocranium (facial skeleton, лицевой отдел)
        - ossicles (inner ear)
        - hyoid bone (подъязычная кость)
      - trunk
        - vertebral column
        - rib cage
    - appendicular skeleton: bones that support the appendages
      - shoulder girdle (плечевой пояс)
      - arm
        - upper arm (brachium, плечо)
          - humerus (плечевая кость)

          - ulna (локтевая)
      - hand
      - pelvic girdle
      - leg
        - upper: femur
        - lower: tibia (thickest) and fibula (side one)
      - foot


## symbiotic relationships

- dependence
  - obligate
    - meaning that one or both of the symbionts entirely depend on each other for survival
  - facultative, optional
    - independent organisms, capable surviving on their own, when necessary

- mutualism (interspecies reciprocal altruism)
  - long-term relationship between individuals of different species where both individuals benefit
  
- parasitism
  - parasite benefits while the host is harmed
  
- mimicry
  - species adopts distinct characteristics of another species 
    - to alter its relationship dynamic with the species being mimicked, to its own advantage
    
- endosymbiosis
  - nutritional dependence

- physical attachment
  - conjunctive
    - symbionts form a single body
  - disjunctive 
    - all other arrangements


## evolutionary thories

- divine creation
- darwinism
  - catastrophism
  - mutogenesis
    - main trains of thought
      - lamarckism
      - darwinism
  - modern synthesis
  
- modern ideas
  - continuous vs discrete increments of fenotype
    - continuous (micromutations)
      - degree of expression of certain genes
        - regulatory proteins
          - modify accessibility of binding sites of dna molecule
            - similarities with event-diven systems in software
    - discrete (macromutations)
      - genome is discrete by itself, so not a big surpise here
      - also can be consequence of a quick/sharp resonanse (chemical?)
