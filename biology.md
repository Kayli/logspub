# notes on biology and related topics


## basics

- cytology: a study of living cells and their structure, behaviour and function

- histology (microscopic anatomy or microanatomy)
  - a branch of biology which studies the microscopic anatomy of biological tissues

- autopoiesis (lit. greek 'self' + 'creation, production')
  - refers to a system capable of producing and maintaining itself by creating its own parts


## cells  [^2] 

- cell: basic structural and functional unit of life form

- cell types
  - by structural advancement
    - procaryotes
      - archaea
      - bacteria
    - eucaryotes
      - animalia
      - fungi
      - plantalia
      - protozoa
        - plasmodium
          - malaria
      - others
  - by chromosome set structure
    - haploid: one set of chromosomes
    - diploid
      - two set of chromosomes, a set of chromosome pairs
      - great majority of animal species and about a half of plant species are diploid

- cell division types
  - mitosis
    - cell divides itself into two identical copies
    - diploid set of chromosomes
  - meiosis (reduction division)
    - cell splits into male-female?? pair
    - gametes
      - are an organism's reproductive cells
      - also referred to as sex cells
      - female gametes are called ova or egg cells, and male gametes are called sperm
    - haploid set of chromosomes
    - sexual reproduction
    - synaptonemal complex
      - to stabilize the chromosome pairs, protein links form along the length of the homologs, like a zipper
      - this zipper seems necessary to allow the homologues to break and recombine
        - thereby exchanging a set of genes between Mom and Dad 
        - before sending the chromosomes into the world aboard egg or sperm


## photosynthesis

- process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy 
  - through cellular respiration this energy can later be released to fuel the organism's activities
- chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules
  - sugars and starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water 
  - 6(CO2) + 6(H2O) + light = C6H12O6[sugar] + 6(O2)





## organisms

- feeding habit
  - autotrophic: can produce their own food
  - heterotrophic: rely on other organisms for food


## mushrooms

- микромице́ты: микроскопические плодовые тела
- макромицеты: большие плодовые тела
  - симбиозные: питание за счет растений
  - базидиомицеты: утилизируют сложные субстраты как целлюлоза

- микотоксины: защита как от других видов грибов так и от поедающих животных
  - экзотоксины - находятся вне, выделяются микроскопическими грибами типа плесени
  - эндотоксины - находятся внутри тела гриба
    - пептиды: могут действовать как гормоны, нейроактивные в-ва и прочее




## symbiotic relationships

- dependence
  - obligate
    - meaning that one or both of the symbionts entirely depend on each other for survival
  - facultative, optional
    - independent organisms, capable surviving on their own, when necessary

- mutualism (interspecies reciprocal altruism)
  - long-term relationship between individuals of different species where both individuals benefit
  
- parasitism
  - parasite benefits while the host is harmed
  
- mimicry
  - species adopts distinct characteristics of another species 
    - to alter its relationship dynamic with the species being mimicked, to its own advantage
    
- endosymbiosis
  - nutritional dependence

- physical attachment
  - conjunctive
    - symbionts form a single body
  - disjunctive 
    - all other arrangements


## evolutionary thories

- divine creation
- darwinism
  - catastrophism
  - mutogenesis
    - main trains of thought
      - lamarckism
      - darwinism
  - modern synthesis
  
- modern ideas
  - continuous vs discrete increments of fenotype
    - continuous (micromutations)
      - degree of expression of certain genes
        - regulatory proteins
          - modify accessibility of binding sites of dna molecule
            - similarities with event-diven systems in software
    - discrete (macromutations)
      - genome is discrete by itself, so not a big surpise here
      - also can be consequence of a quick/sharp resonanse (chemical?)
