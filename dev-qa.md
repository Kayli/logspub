# notes related to quality assurance practices in software

## basics

- synthetic testing (synthetic monitoring, proactive monitoring)
  - is a method of understanding a userâ€™s experience of your application
  - is a way to identify performance issues with key user journeys and application endpoints before they degrade user experience
  - connect to test servers (usually in different locations around the world) and use behavioral scripts to simulate the typical actions of end-users


## clusters

- failure scenarios
  - more than half of the cluster nodes lose connection with the cluster, resulting in quorum loss
    - cluster recovery process may be involved
    - it better be automated and tested beforehand


## performance testing

- load testing: performance assessment under given average load
- stress testing: system stability under extreme conditions
- soak testing: reliability over a longer period of time
- spike Testing: simulates huge spike of load on a very short period of time
