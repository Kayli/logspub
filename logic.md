# topics related to logic

## basics

- modus ponens
    - P implies Q. P is true. Therefore Q must also be true
    - also known as
      - modus ponendo ponens (Latin for "method of putting by placing")
      - implication elimination or affirming the antecedent
    - is a deductive argument form and rule of inference

- inferences: are steps in reasoning, moving from premises to logical consequences

- antecedent (protasis)
  - first half of a hypothetical proposition, whenever the if-clause precedes the then-clause

- contraposition
  - inference of going from a conditional statement into its logically equivalent contrapositive
  - contrapositive of P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P

- conversion: Q → P is conversion of P → Q


## logical fallacies

- false dilemma
  - also referred to as false dichotomy
  - is an informal fallacy based on a premise that erroneously limits what options are available

- strawman argument

- sunk cost

- perception of truth
  - happens by means of
    - rhyme
    - alliteration
      - most alliteration comes from repeated first letters (such as “calling cats”)
      - but it also works with repeated sounds and different letters (such as “calling kittens”)
    - blank verse poetry
      - written with regular metrical but unrhymed lines
  - may only be indicative of higher levels of intelligence of an interlocutor
    - but doesn't tell anything about logical consistency of their statements

- psychological pricing
  - 9.99 can be simulteneously percieved as 
    - big number (lots of nines)
    - smaller number than the real price (oh, its just 9 bucks)
  - slaps you twice
  - when chance of seeing such price is above random threshold 
    - it is indicative of dishonest/unethical market pricing strategies that company engaged in

- begging the question [^1]
  - occurs when an argument's premises assume the truth of the conclusion, instead of supporting it
  - example: happiness is the highest good for a human being, since all other values are inferior to it
