- modus ponens
    - P implies Q. P is true. Therefore Q must also be true
    - also known as
      - modus ponendo ponens (Latin for "method of putting by placing")
      - implication elimination or affirming the antecedent
    - is a deductive argument form and rule of inference

- inferences: are steps in reasoning, moving from premises to logical consequences

- antecedent (protasis)
  - first half of a hypothetical proposition, whenever the if-clause precedes the then-clause

- contraposition
  - inference of going from a conditional statement into its logically equivalent contrapositive
  - contrapositive of P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P

- conversion: Q → P is conversion of P → Q

- logical biconditional P <-> Q
  - means that P implies Q and Q implies P
  - alternative notations: iff, <=>, =, an equivalence sign (≡), EQV
  - sometimes known as the material biconditional, is the logical connective used to conjoin two 
    statements P and Q to form the statement "P if and only if Q"
