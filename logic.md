## basics [^1]

- truth-functional propositional logic
  - formulas are interpreted as having precisely one of two possible truth values, 
    the truth value of true or the truth value of false
  - principle of bivalence and the law of excluded middle are upheld

- inferences: are steps in reasoning, moving from premises to logical consequences

- conjunction: logical 'and' notated as '∧' 
  - mnemonic: 'cap', same number of letters as word 'and'
- disjunction: logical 'or' notated as 'v' 
  - mnemonic 'versus'

- antecedent (protasis)
  - first half of a hypothetical proposition, whenever the if-clause precedes the then-clause

- consequent
  - second half of a hypothetical proposition

- modus ponens (implication elimination or affirming the antecedent)
    - P implies Q. P is true. Therefore Q must also be true
    - also known as
      - modus ponendo ponens (Latin for "method of putting by placing")
      - implication elimination or affirming the antecedent
    - is a deductive argument form and rule of inference

- contraposition
  - inference of going from a conditional statement into its logically equivalent contrapositive
  - contrapositive of P → Q is ¬Q → ¬P

- modus tollens (denying the consequent)
  - if P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.
  - pretty much the same as contraposition: if a statement is true, then so is its contrapositive

- conversion: Q → P is conversion of P → Q

- logical biconditional P <-> Q
  - means that P implies Q and Q implies P
  - alternative notations: iff, <=>, =, an equivalence sign (≡), EQV
  - sometimes known as the material biconditional, is the logical connective used to conjoin two 
    statements P and Q to form the statement "P if and only if Q"
