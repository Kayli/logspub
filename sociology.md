# random notes about sociology

## basics

- founding thinkers of modern sociology
  - Émile Durkheim 1858–1917
  - Max Weber 1864–1920
  - Karl Marx 1818–1883

- milgram social psychology experiments [^1]
  - study obedience to authority figures
  - participants were asked 
    - to give a simple task to another participant (an actor)
    - administer electric shocks of different strength for a wrong answer 
  - experiment found
    - very high proportion of subjects would fully obey the instructions

- stanford prison experiment [^2]
  - was designed to examine the effects of situational variables on participant's
    reactions and behaviors in a two-week simulation of a prison environment
  - experiment found
    - following five days, psychological abuse of the prisoners by the "guards" became increasingly brutal
    - had to stop experiment on the sixth day


## religion

- what is religion [^3]
  - things that surpass the limits of our knowledge (durkheim)
  - a sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of 
    soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people (marx)

- performs the key function of providing social solidarity in a society
  - rituals, worship of icons, and belief in supernatural beings 
    “excite, maintain or recreate certain mental states” (Durkheim 1912) 
  - brings people together, provide a ritual and symbolic focus, and unify them
  - this referred as functionalist perspective in sociology

- protestants vs catholics (by max weber)
  - catholics are more community focused, but protestants are more individualistic
    - poverty is a virtue and labour simply a means for maintaining the individual and community
  - protestants are more likely reflect the values of hard work and savings conducive to capitalist ideology
    - hard, continuous labour as a spiritual end in itself
    - such values influenced the rise of capitalism and helped create the modern world order

  - indicated 5 main reasons:
    - individualism: more personal responsibilities for a failure
    - excessive hope
    - too much freedom: 'whatever works for you'
    - atheism
