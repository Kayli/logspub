# notes on logic

- informal logic
  - examines arguments expressed in natural language
  - associated with informal fallacies, critical thinking, and argumentation theory
  - wikipedia says that bayesian logic is informal (but why???) 

- formal logic
  - examples: algebraic logic, boolean logic
  - see math/logic-formal.md for more details

- approaches
  - pragmatic or dialogical approach
    - composed of arguments as speech acts occuring in a context which affects the standards of right and wrong arguments
    - dialogues are games of persuasion
      - each player has the goal of convincing the opponent of their own conclusion
      - arguments are the moves of the game
      - winning move 
        - is a successful argument 
          - that takes the opponent's commitments as premises
          - and shows how one's own conclusion follows from them
      - fallacy
        - is a violation of the standards of proper argumentative rules
    - rhetoric (/ˈrɛtərɪk/): is the art of persuasion


## argumentation [1]

- claim: statement that asserts something to be the case or not to be the case
    - can be
      - true or false
      - percievable or not
      - real or imaginary
      - resolvable or not
      - agreed upon or controversial
    - examples
      - we should raise tuition
      - batman will beat spiderman in a battle
      - freedom is good

- issue: a controversial claim
  - composed of claim and counterclaim (the opposite)
  - example: should we raise tuition?

- argument: a set of claims
  - claims can be
    - premises: represent support for the conclusion
    - conclusion: claim we want to agree on

  - what's not an argument
    - non-controversial claim, one that everyone agrees with
    - a single claim without supporting evidence, premises (other supporting claims)
    - a bunch of unrelated or weekly related claims jumbled all together
    - ceremonial language
      - example: 'Esteemed colleagues, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens, today, as we gather on this auspicious occasion, we stand at the threshold of a new era. It is a moment of great significance ...'
  
  - can be
    - deductive
      - given premises, conclusion is certain
      - examples
        - socrates is a man, all man are mortal -> socrates is mortal
        - socrates is in jail, everybody in jail are guilty -> socrates broke the law
    - inductive
      - given premises, conclusion is likely 
      - examples
        - socrates is in jail, people in jail usually broke the law -> socrates broke the law
