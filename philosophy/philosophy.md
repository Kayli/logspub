  - literally: love of wisdom
  - the most generic type of inquiry

- reason
  - ability to think logically, critically, and analytically in order to make sense of the world around us
  - capacity for rational thought and inference, based on evidence and experience
    - enables us to arrive at sound judgments and make informed decisions

  - so its about one person vs group judgment, where group is likely some scientific community

- epistemology (greek 'episteme' meaning knowledge)
  - theory of knowledge, the branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge
  - nominalism: categories are names, we create them, no universal entities

- metaphysics - theory of reality
  - ontology
    - branch of philosophy that studies concepts such as existence, being, becoming, and reality
    - includes the questions of
      - how entities are grouped into basic categories
      - which of these entities exist on the most fundamental level

- phenomenology
  - study of the structures of experience and consciousness

- axiology (greek 'axios' meaning worthy, worth, of like value)
  - is the philosophical study of value
  - axiological point or judgement: value judgement

- teleology, finality (greek 'teleos' meaning entire, perfect, complete)
  - explanation for something which serves as a function of its end, its purpose, or its goal
  - intrinsic: something which serves as a function of its cause (like acorn turns into an oak tree)
  - extrinsic: purpose that is imposed by a human use
- teleological explanation: based on consiseration of goals

- eschatology
  - part of theology
  - concerned with death, judgement, and the final destiny of the soul and of humankind

- continental philosophy
  - philosophy of continental europe which is not analytic philosophy
  - used as a pejorative by analytic philosophers

- critique
  - systematic inquiry into the conditions and consequences of a concept, a theory, a discipline

    - theorems define truth statements derived from axioms and other proven theorems (recursive definition)
    - most relevant in formal sciences

- how we detect lies?
  - absence of expected evidence
  - presence of conflicting evidence

- blind faith demands that we disregard
  - absence of expected evidence
  - presence of conflicting evidence

- robert oppenheimer quote
  - 'we know that the only way to avoid error is to detect it and the only way to detect it is to be free to inquire'


## relativism, antirealism

- standards of truth, rationality, and ethical right and wrong vary greatly between cultures and historical epochs 
  - there are no universal criteria for picking best between them


## pragmatism

- is a philosophical tradition
- considers words and thoughts as tools and instruments for prediction, problem solving, and action
- it rejects the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent, or mirror reality


## evolutionary epistemology

- main contributors: karl popper, konrad lorenz, donald campbell
- lorenz writes: kant's synthetic apriori is true in light of darwinian biology
  - our cognitive apparatus evolved under to pressure of things in themselves in order to percieve them in ways that matter for survival


## causality

- relationship between an event (the cause) and a second event (the effect), where the second event is a result of the first

- can be established through experimental design 
  - researchers manipulate an independent variable and measure its effect on a dependent variable

- theories of causality

  - deterministic
    - every effect has a single, definite cause that can be traced back to a previous event or state

  - probabilistic
    - effect may have multiple possible causes, each with a certain probability of occurring
    - bayesian networks
      - represented by conditional probabilities that specify the likelihood of an effect given its possible causes

  - counterfactual/interventionist
    - cause is an event that, if it had not occurred, would have prevented the effect from occurring

  - agency theories
    - actions of agents who intentionally bring about the effect

- establishing causality
  - in medicine: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
  - no causation without manipulation (paul holland)
    - to find out what happens when you change something, it is necessary to change it
    - there are things you learn from perturbing a system that you'll never find out from any amount of passive observation. [5]


## space and time

- space and time are mental constructs
  - leibniz, kant and einstein were proponents of this idea 
  - emerge from interactions between different parts of matter


## taoism, daoism

- yin and yang
  - describes opposite but interconnected forces
  - yin is the receptive and yang the active principle


## hellenism

- epicurianism: self-sufficiency, pleasure, friendship, materialism
- cynics: don't care about social conventions (diogenes)
- stoics: fatalism, dog tight to a cart being moved by a horse
- scepticism: suspend judgement as we never can be fully certain
- neoplatonism
- aristotelianism


## interesting ideas

- "consciousness is always present for itself" thomas w. clark 
- reincarnation is just a poetic expression of what collective memory is [2]
- embracing anxiety as a natural emotion that animates body [3]
- бытие определяет сознание ... еще это назвают проф деформацией [4]
- disappointing people may be very humanizing, it can give those the opportunity to realize that their demands might not be reasonable [6]
