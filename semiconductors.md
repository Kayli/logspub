# self paced course notes about semiconductors and closely related tech

## basics

- wafer (also called a slice or substrate)
  - thin slice of semiconductor, such as a crystalline silicon (c-Si)
  - used for the fabrication of integrated circuits and, in photovoltaics, to manufacture solar cells
  - subdivided into a bunch of "standard cells"

- doping
  - intentional introduction of impurities into an intrinsic semiconductor 
    for the purpose of modulating its electrical, optical and structural properties
  - only a small fraction of dopant atoms is needed 
    - to significantly alter the electrical properties of silicon
    - doping of phosphorus (n-type) or boron (p-type) in concentrations as low as parts per million

- layering
  - typical motherboard has 12 track layers
  - typical processor die has 20+ layers
    - but only a single transistor layer
      - however there are 3D stacking or 3D integration techniques companies slowly adopt

- mosfet
  - is a type of insulated-gate field-effect transistor that is fabricated by the controlled 
    oxidation of a semiconductor, typically silicon
  - metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET, MOS-FET, or MOS FET)
  - also known as the metal–oxide–silicon transistor (MOS transistor, or MOS)

- ASIC - application-specific integrated circuit device (chip)

- SPICE circuit simulator
  - "to SPICE a circuit" remains synonymous with circuit simulation

- extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV or EUVL) 
  - is an optical lithography technology used in steppers, machines that make integrated 
    circuits (ICs) for computers and other electronic devices

- stepper
  - is a device used in the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs) that is similar in operation 
    to a slide projector or a photographic enlarger
  - is short for step-and-repeat camera
  - today, step-and-scan systems are so widespread that they are often simply referred to as steppers
