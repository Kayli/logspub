# self paced course notes about semiconductors and closely related tech

## basics

- wafer (also called a slice or substrate)
  - thin slice of semiconductor, such as a crystalline silicon (c-Si)
  - used for the fabrication of integrated circuits and, in photovoltaics, to manufacture solar cells
  - subdivided into a bunch of "standard cells"

- doping
  - intentional introduction of impurities into an intrinsic semiconductor 
    for the purpose of modulating its electrical, optical and structural properties

- typical motherboard has 12 track layers

- mosfet
  - is a type of insulated-gate field-effect transistor that is fabricated by the controlled 
    oxidation of a semiconductor, typically silicon
  - metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET, MOS-FET, or MOS FET)
  - also known as the metal–oxide–silicon transistor (MOS transistor, or MOS)

- ASIC - application-specific integrated circuit device (chip)

- SPICE circuit simulator
  - "to SPICE a circuit" remains synonymous with circuit simulation

## some stuff not sure i'll ever need

- GDS
  - database file format 
  - which is the de facto industry standard for data exchange of integrated circuit 
    or IC layout artwork
- DRC - design rule checking tool
- LEF 
  - specification for representing the physical layout of an integrated circuit 
    in an ASCII format
- DEF - design exchange format
