# notes related to neuroscience

## basics [^3]

- study of the mind as an empirical epistemology
  - helps to understand the origins and limitations of human knowledge

- gyrification
  - process of forming the characteristic folds of the cerebral cortex
  - happens due to impossibility of rapid changes in brain tissue architecture
  - does not increase total brain volume contrary to some myths or sloppy formulations
    - but only an volume of cortical tissues

- organization of the brain reveals architecture of the mind
  - fundamental pieces of the brain tell us about fundamental parts of the mind

- some parts of the brain do extremely specific things e.g:
  - face recognition (back end of the bottom right hemisphere)
  - numbers and counting

- limitations
  - there is no neuron-wiring-level diagram that explains any high-level mental function (as of 2021)


## brain facts

- the brain has about 10¹¹ neurons and 1.8-3.2 x 10¹⁴ synapses
  - of these 10%-30% neurons are in the cerebral cortex
  - to compare, there are
    - 7.5 x 10^18 grains of sand on earth
    - 10^21 stars and 10^82 atoms in the observable universe
    - 10^21 molecules in a drop of water

- 10¹¹ glial cells (the same as the number of neurons)
  - timescales of glial dynamics are substantially longer than for neuron dynamics
  - Newman and Zahs 1998 mechanically stimulate glial cells in a rat retina, and find that this stimulation
    results in slow-moving waves of increased calcium? concentration
    - these ?calcium? waves had an effect on neuron activity
    - these speeds are about a million times slower than action potential propagation (neuron firing)

- grey matter
  - neuronal cell bodies 

- white matter
  - consists of myelinated axons
  - 45% of human brain
  - specific connections of each region may serve as a 'fingerpring' of that region across species
    - enables us to discover interspecies homologies


## brain anatomy [^2]

- forebrain (передний мозг)
  - cerebrum (конечный мозг)
    - cerebral cortex
      - temporal lobe (side)
        - olfactory cortex, sense of smell
      - occipital lobe (back)
        - visual cortex

- midbrain (средний мозг)
  - referred as limbic system
  - functions: vision, hearing, motor control, sleep and wakefulness, arousal (alertness), and temperature regulation
  - thalamus
    - most sensory information goes through it on its way to the cortex (except olfactory)
    - there is 10x more connections that go backwards from visual cortex back to thalamus (feedback) than forwards
    - has many regions (nuclei) associated with different functions
      - lateral geniculate nucleus (lgn): key component of the mammalian visual pathway
  - septum
  - amygdalae
    - primary role in the processing of memory, decision making 
    - emotional responses (including fear, anxiety, and aggression)
    - electrical stimulations of the right amygdala induced negative emotions, especially fear and sadness. In contrast, stimulation of the left amygdala was able to induce either pleasant (happiness) or unpleasant (fear, anxiety, sadness) emotions
  - hypothalamus
    - drives for sex, food, thirst
  - hippocampal complex
    - memory?
  - cingulate cortex

- hindbrain
  - brain stem (мозговой ствол)

## neurons

- main components
  - cell body with nucleus
  - dendrites
  - axons

- critical component of the action potential is the rise in intracellular calcium that activates both 
  small conductance potassium channels essential during membrane repolarization, and triggers transmitter 
  release from the cell


## neurotransmitters

- glutamic acid (or glutamate, ionic form)
  - aminoacid
  - the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system
    - main medium for passing information streams around central nervous system
    - about 40% of all neurons
  - functions
    - transmitting sensory and motor signals
    - short term memory, recollection
  - mechanism
    - at chemical synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles
    - nerve impulses trigger release of glutamate from the presynaptic cell
    - binds to nmda receptor
      - receptor can be blocked by mg ion
        - which may sched some light on mechanisms of
          - attention
            - активация через соседний рецептор ampa, приводящая к выбиванию магниевой пробки
            - после этого синапс способен проводить даже слабый сигнал
          - memory

    - about 40% of all neurons
  - its principal role is reducing neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system
  - examples of functions
    - attention
    - locomotion control

- acetylcholine
  - playing an important role in arousal, attention, memory and motivation
