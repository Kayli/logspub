# notes about geology and related topics


## atmospheric science

- atmosphere 
  - is an important transitional zone between the solid planetary surface and the higher rarefied ionizing and radiation belts
  - a set of layers of gases surrounding a planet or other material body, that is held in place by the gravity of that body


### earth

- atmospheric layers
  - exosphere 700km to 10,000km
  - thermosphere 80km to 700km
    - ionosphere 80km to 550km
  - mesosphere 50km to 80km
  - stratosphere 12km to 50km
      - ozone layer (at the top of the stratosphere)
  - troposphere 12km above the surface

- atmospheric composition
  - nitrogen (about 78%)
  - oxygen (about 21%)
  - argon (about 0.9%)
  - carbon dioxide (0.04%)
  - other gases in trace amounts

- artificial satellites
  - more than 3300 operational artificial satellites flying around the earth
  - experience slow orbital decay, need to be boosted to avoid burning in atmosphere
    - its a necessary process required to get rid of space junk
  - iss[^1] has to make regular maneuvers to avoid space junk

- space junk
  - 10k of objects large enough to be tracked by a radar
    - uncontrolled and fast-moving
  - 100 million pieces of debree
  - 3 million kgs of space junk in total
  - kesler syndrome: positive feedback cycle of ever-growing number of fragments of space-junk
  - rockets passing through lower and higher levels of atmosphere have relatively low chance of hitting space junk
  - much higher chance of encounter is for objects which are staying on the orbit
  - low orbits up to 400km will clean up automatically after 10 years
    - considering that we don't add more junk during that time


## geology [^2]

- gravel: grain size > 2mm diameter
- sand: grain size 1/16 - 2 mm diameter
- silt: grain size 1/256 - 1/16 mm diameter
- clay
  - grain size: < 1/256 (< 0.004mm)
  - synonymous to mud
  - not a composition of materials, but defined by grain size


### seismology

- seismic sea waves have a period of about 20 minutes, and speeds of 760 km/h
