- monopsony

    its global deposits and possessing large spare production capacity
  - able to increase or decrease commodity supply at minimal additional internal cost
    - able to influence prices and balance the markets, providing downside protection in the short to middle term


## macroeconomics

- country's central bank provides accounts for
  - sovereign government
    - from which the government can spend and also receive taxes and other inflows
  - every commercial bank
    - by means of which it manages its reserves (that is, money for clearing and settling interbank transactions)

- key scenarios
  - government spends money
    - its treasury takes money from central bank's operating account and deposits this money into private bank accounts (and hence into the commercial banking system)
  - taxation
    - private bank accounts are debited; thus, deposits in the commercial banking sector fall.
  - Central Bank sells bonds, removing reserves from the banking system
  - Central Bank buys bonds by simply creating money – it is not financed in any way
