# notes on economics and related topics

## basics



- means of production (средства производства)
  - surplus value (добавочная стоимость)
    - value produced by workers that is in excess of the value required to compensate them for their labor
  - proletariat
    - working-class people who do not own the means of production, such as factories, land, or other resources 
    - they must sell their labor in exchange for wages in order to survive
    - is exploited by the capitalist class, which owns and controls the means of production


## goods (товары)

- definition
  - physical product that can be bought and sold in a market

- can be either durable or non-durable, depending on how long they last

- examples: food, clothing, electronics, crude oil

- types

  - public goods
    - can be consumed by multiple individuals without diminishing their availability
    - examples: public parks, national defense, streetlights

  - private goods
    - they can only be consumed by those who have purchased
    - consumption by one individual reduces availability for others
    - examples: clothing, food, electronics

  - consumer goods
    - produced for final consumption by individuals or households
    - examples: clothing, electronics, food, personal care products

  - intermediate goods
    - used in the production of other goods but not directly consumed by individuals
    - examples: raw materials, components, semi-finished goods

  - capital goods
    - used in the production of other goods and for long-term investment
    - essential attributes
      - durable and are expected to last for a long time
      - expensive and require significant investment
    - examples: machinery, tools, buildings, and equipment that are used to produce other goods and services

  - commodities
    - produced and sold in large quantities, usually on a global market
    - generally raw materials or primary products that are used to produce other goods
    - examples: crude oil, wheat, gold, and copper


## market

- structures
  - monopoly
    - there is only one supplier of a particular product or service, and no close substitutes are available
    - supplier has complete control over the supply of the product or service
      - can charge higher prices than would be possible in a competitive market

  - oligopoly
    - small number of firms control a significant share of the market for a particular product or service
    - unlike a monopoly, there are multiple firms in an oligopoly, but the market is still dominated by a few large players

  - quasi monopoly [1]
    - there are competitors but one supplier holds the majority of the marketplace
    - example: google in search engines space in america

  - monopsony
    - situation when a single entity has a market power over all sellers as the only buyer of a good or service

  - oligopsony
    - same as monopsony but with a few buyers

- swing producer
  - is a supplier or a close oligopolistic group of suppliers of any commodity, controlling 
    its global deposits and possessing large spare production capacity
  - able to increase or decrease commodity supply at minimal additional internal cost
    - able to influence prices and balance the markets, providing downside protection in the short to middle term


## macroeconomics

- country's central bank provides accounts for
  - sovereign government
    - from which the government can spend and also receive taxes and other inflows
  - every commercial bank
    - by means of which it manages its reserves (that is, money for clearing and settling interbank transactions)

- key scenarios
  - government spends money
    - its treasury takes money from central bank's operating account and deposits this money into private bank accounts (and hence into the commercial banking system)
  - taxation
    - private bank accounts are debited; thus, deposits in the commercial banking sector fall.
  - Central Bank sells bonds, removing reserves from the banking system
  - Central Bank buys bonds by simply creating money – it is not financed in any way


## global

- wallerstein's world system theory model countries classification [4]
  - core: high profit consumption goods
  - semi-periphery
  - periphery: cheap labor and raw materials (ресурсное государство)


## prices

- the price of oil influences about 65% of food prices [2]


## capitalism

- main elements: private property, markets, companies
