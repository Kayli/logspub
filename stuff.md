- instrument vs security [^1]
  - financial instrument is a broader term
    - refers to those traded in money markets, capital markets, FX markets, spot market, and derivatives
  - security refers only to equity or debt instruments. 
    - it has some sort of protection in case there will be liquidity risk. 
  - example
    - foreign exchange markets can't be considered a security because it's very volatile, no guarantee if loss
