## vague terms

## political language

- problems [^1]
  - circus of unnecessarily complex words 
    - which are completely devoid of imagery 
    - in an attempt to fane sophistication
  - lack of precision
    - 'fascist' often signifies 'something not desirable'
    - democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice 
      - have multiple often incompatible meanings


## manipulative strategies

- abusing emotional, cultural, tribal cues [^2]



## interesting ideas

- america as a functional gerontocracy
  - form of oligarchical rule

    the holders of the most power
