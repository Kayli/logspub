## political language

- problems [^1]
  - circus of unnecessarily complex words 
    - which are completely devoid of imagery 
    - in an attempt to fane sophistication
  - lack of precision
    - 'fascist' often signifies 'something not desirable'
    - words have multiple often incompatible meanings
      - democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice 

- euphemisms
  - to energize people - appeal to their emotions


## manipulative strategies

- abusing emotional, cultural, tribal cues [^2]
  - opposed to making rational, competence-based appeal

- create illusion of fairness (veneer democracy)
- capture people's attention for the sake of capturing attention (clownwork)
  - in order to divert it from problems that average joe cares about

- divide and conquer
  - prevent people from trusting each other [^3]


## propaganda

- может содержать ложь, но
  - может содержать только истинные факты, но они будут подобраны и поданы таким образом, чтобы
    осуществить свою главную цель: изменить ваше мнение и посредствам этого изменить ваше поведение [^5]

- знание - власть (фрэнсис бэкон)
  - наличие образования помогает понимать как устроено знание и откуда берется научная картина мира
  - фактов неизмеримое количество и они могут быть выстроены в любой последовательности


## interesting ideas

- america as a functional gerontocracy
  - form of oligarchical rule
  - entity is ruled by leaders who are significantly older than most of the adult population
  - in many political structures, power within the ruling class accumulates with age, making the oldest 
    the holders of the most power

- weed pm justin trudeau [^4]
  - considered one by some, as he won election because of mj legalization program support
