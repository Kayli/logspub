  - in order to divert it from problems that average joe cares about

- divide and conquer
  - prevent people from trusting each other [^3]


## propaganda [^5]

- может содержать ложь, но
  - может содержать только истинные факты, но они будут подобраны и поданы таким образом, чтобы
    осуществить свою главную цель: изменить ваше мнение и посредствам этого изменить ваше поведение

- знание - власть (фрэнсис бэкон)
  - наличие образования помогает понимать как устроено знание и откуда берется научная картина мира
  - фактов неизмеримое количество и они могут быть выстроены в любой последовательности

- национальная идея
  - использование людей как средство
  - человек не может быть средством, а только целью (хаха)

## war

  - petri-dish approach on global scale


## interesting ideas

- america as a functional gerontocracy
  - form of oligarchical rule
  - entity is ruled by leaders who are significantly older than most of the adult population
  - in many political structures, power within the ruling class accumulates with age, making the oldest 
    the holders of the most power

- weed pm justin trudeau [^4]
  - considered one by some, as he won election because of mj legalization program support

- ernest becker, the birth and death of meaning
  - p177: they [will] need others less for support, and so do not automatically see gray temples as fatherly 
    wisdom and are not likely to be taken in my the magical power of a deep and rumbling voice. instead, they
    they would tend to judge the leader on his acts and his judgment.
    the self-reliant person would be suspicious of easy promises and wild expectations because he has himself 
    learned that reality is not generous but has to be approached correctly and patiently; and so he would also 
    mistrust those who scorn reality by trying to push it, force it into fantasy or who fear it and try to over-control it.
    a citizenry composed of large number of such people would be something to reckon with, because they would 
    respect reality, bend to it, work it and survive with it. best of all ... they would place most of those who 
    hold prominent political office today back in real-estate offices, restauraunts, cigar and clothing stores 
    which they never would have left, where it for the fantasies of the masses
