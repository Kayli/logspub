# chemistry self-paced course notes


## basics

- mass vs weight
  - mass is independent from the force of gravity

- atomic mass
  - protons and neutrons of the nucleus account for nearly all of the total mass of atoms
  - expressed in amu or daltons (symbol: Da, amu or u)
    - where 1 dalton is defined as 1⁄12 of the mass of a single carbon-12 atom, at rest

- molar mass (sometimes called molecular weight)
  - 1 mole = 6.02214*10^23 molecules of stuff, which is called avogadro's number
  - one mole of stuff X and one mole of stuff Y contain same number of particles
  - it weights depending on what it is, here are some examples:
    - 1 mole of hydrogen weights 1g
    - 1 mole of water weights 18g
      - H2O = 2 + 16 = 18 g/mol
  - its composite
    - in order to get molar mass of a complex compound you can add molar masses of its constituents

- chemical reaction: reactants -> products
- molarity (M)
  - measures concentration
  - moles of solute per liter of solution

- isotopes
  - atoms that differ only by the number of neutrons in a nucleus
  - e.g. chlorine-35 (75.77% of all chlorine atoms) and chlorine-37 (24.23%)

- isomers
  - definition
    - molecules having same formula but spacial arrangement is different
  - structural isomers - different bondings
  - stereo isomers
    - cis-trans (geometric) isomers
    - enantiomers - for example, a mirrored molecule
  - polymorphs
    - compounds that can adopt different forms and/or crystal structures
    - polymorphism is a form of isomerism

- stoichiometry
  - relationship between the quantities of reactants and products before, during, and following chemical reactions
  - scheme: unit given -> moles -> moles -> unit requested


## atomic structure important for a chemist

- models of the atom
  - dalton's 1808: ball
  - thompson's 1904: plum pudding 
  - rutheford's 1911: nuclear
  - bohr's 1913: planetary, onion-like configuration
  - schrodinger 1920: orbitals
    - orbital are kinda standing waves, shapes defining probabilities where electrons may be found

- nucleus composed of nucleons: protons and neutrons
- number of protons are usually equal to number of electrons
- electrons are organized into shells and subshells
- atoms are grouped by a number of valence electrons
  - valence electrons are ones located in a valence shell
  - atom's valence shell is the outermost electron shell


## periodic table

- major divisions
  - rows/periods
  - columns/families/groups
  - metals / non-metals / metalloids
    - there are a lot more metals than non-metals
    - metals tend to lose electrons to form positive ions
    - non-metals tend to gain electrons to form negative ions
 

## ions

- ions are charged atoms
- two types
  - anions - negatively charged ions, formed after gaining electrons
  - cations - positively charged ions, formed after losing electrons

- formed by 
  - addition of electrons to, or the removal of electrons from, neutral atoms or molecules or other ions
    - e.g. ionizing radiation
    - or reaction of a sodium atom with a chlorine atom to form a sodium cation and a chloride anion
  - combination of ions with other particles
    - e.g. addition of a hydrogen cation to an ammonia molecule to form an ammonium cation
  - rupture of a covalent bond between two atoms 
    - in such a way that both of the electrons of the bond are left in association with one of the formerly bonded atoms
    - e.g. dissociation of a water molecule to form a hydrogen cation and a hydroxide anion

- ionic solid
  - formed by positive and negative ions, e.g. NaCl


## bonds

- bond types: ionic, covalent, metallic, intermolecular

- ionic
  - between two ions of opposite charges
  - one element provides while another element borrows an electron

- covalent
  - when atoms or ions share electrons such that their outer shells become occupied
  - one or more electrons (often a pair of electrons) are drawn into the space between the two atomic nuclei
    - energy is released by bond formation
  - can be
    - non-polar: valence electrons are equally spaced between two atoms
    - polar: valence electrons closer to one of the atoms
    - single: one pair of electrons is shared
    - double: where two pairs of electrons are shared between the atoms rather than just one pair
    - triple
  
- metallic bond
  - electrons able to move freely between neiboring atoms

- intermolecule
  - hydrogen bonds
    - have only about 1/20 the strength of a covalent bond
    - examples of molecules with hydrogen bonds
      - Water: The bond is between the hydrogen of one water molecule and the oxygen atoms of another, not between the two hydrogen atoms (a common misconception).
      - DNA: Hydrogen bonds form between base pairs. This gives DNA its  and makes replication of the strands possible, as they "unzip" along the hydrogen bonds.
      - proteins:  result in protein folding, which helps the molecule maintain stability and assume a functional configuration.


## molecules

- molecular orbitals 
  - are approximate solutions to the Schrodinger equation for the electrons in the electric field 
    of the molecule's atomic nuclei
  - most commonly a MO is represented as a linear combination of atomic orbitals (the LCAO-MO method),
    especially in qualitative or very approximate usage


## water

- chemical formula H2O
- each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms
  - connected by single covalent bonds
  - bonds are polar
    - oxygen atoms have a slight negative charge (from the presence extra electron share)
    - hydrogens are slightly positive (from the extra un-neutralized protons)
- hydrogen bond
  - slight positive charges on the hydrogen atoms in a water molecule attract the slight
    negative charges on the oxygen atoms of other water molecules forming intermolecular bond
    with tiny force of attraction. 
  - its only a small fraction of the strength of a covalent bond, but, there are a lot of such bonds
    and they impart some very special properties to the substance we call water.


## radioactive

- some radioisotopes
  - hydrogen-3 (tritium)
  - berillium-7, berillium-10
  - carbon-14
  - sodium-22
  - alluminium-26
  - clorine-36
  - potassium-40
  - lead-212

    Ds, Rg, Cn, Nh, Fl, Mc, Lv, Ts, Og (oganesson)


## compounds

- acids, bases, salts
  - a salt is a substance obtained by the reaction of an acid and a base
    - salts are composed of positive ions (cations) of bases and negative ions (anions) of acids
  - the reaction of acid and base is called the neutralization reaction
  - alkalies are strong bases soluable in water

- alcohols, phenols, ethers


## organic chemistry

- substituent (or functional group, side chain, pendant group, moiety)
  - one or a group of atoms that replaces (one or more) hydrogen atoms on the parent chain of a hydrocarbon
    thereby becoming a moiety in the resultant (new) molecule
  - usually defines the molecule's characteristic chemical reactions

- focuses on carbon-based molecules and related stuff

- basic principles of carbon molecules formation
  - carbon-carbon bonds are unusually strong
  - can form up to 4 covalent bonds with other atoms, forming backbone of a macromolecule
  - carbon can form a stable, sturdy backbone for a large molecule

- hydrocarbons (углеводороды)
  - composed by: carbon and hydrogen
  - examples
    - methane
      - the carbon and the four hydrogen atoms form the vertices of a three-dimensional shape known as a tetrahedron
        - which has four triangular faces
      - because of this, methane is said to have a tetrahedral geometry
    - ethane, propane, butane, pentane, cyclopentane, propylene, benzene
  - biosynthesis
    - methane producing organisms have been identified only from the domain archaea
    - it is common for microorganisms to produce hydrocarbons other than methane  
      - there is a wide diversity of hydrocarbon structures being made
  - spatial orientation
    - when a carbon atom is bonded to four other atoms
      - the molecule (or part of a molecule) will take on a tetrahedral shape similar to that of methane
    - this happens because the electron pairs that make up the bonds repel each other
      - and the shape that maximizes their distance from each other is a tetrahedron

- carbohydrates (углеводы)
  - composed by: carbon, hydrogen and oxygen
  - are very important as living organisms metabolize carbohydrates for energy
  - groups: monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides
  - examples
    - glucose, galactose, fructose

- hydrocarbons vs carbohydrates
  - they sound similar but are two very different types of compounds
  - hydrocarbons c, while carbohydrates also contain oxygen
  - living organisms metabolize carbohydrates for energy, whereas hydrocarbons are used as fuels and in industrial applications

- glucose visually looks related to ethanol (alcohol) and water molecules
    - at least i can see similarity by just looking at space-filling models of them

- carbon monoxide (CO)
  - colourless and odourless gas at room temperature, not naturally present in the atmosphere
  - concentration: in earth's troposphere is around 0.1 ppm which is about 400 Tg [^8]
