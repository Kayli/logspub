# notes about pandas framework

## general information

- data analysis and manipulation tool for python
- foss friendly
- built on top of scipy
- columns can be sometimes referred as 'variables'
  - pretty common terminology for many kinds of datascience content


## useful objects

- dataframe object [^1]
  - is similar to dictionary of columns (arrays)
  - dictionary records are named columns of the loaded data
  - dictionary record values are like arrays of typed data
  - columns data modelled as Series object, which is 1d array

- dataframe index [^3]
  - there are two kinds of indexes
    - integer index
      - provides a numeric index to retrieve specific rows and columns
      - iloc method enables you to retrieve rows and columns by the integer location
    - row label index
      - provides label for the rows
      - you can think of the index sort of like a special column
        - but it will not be listed with the columns
      - by default, index is the range of numbers starting at 0
        - which may be confusing, because default behavior resembles integer index
        - but this is just a coinscedence
        - index has type RangeIndex in this case
      - we can also manually define an index
        - this is just an object which represents group of labels for the rows
        - df.set_index function
          - allows you to set one of the columns of DataFrame as the index 
          - if you set drop = False
            - set_index will transform the column into the index, but it will also keep the old column
          - df.reset_index reverses set_index operation: index 'column' becomes an ordinary column
        - index will likely have a type Index with dtype='object' in this case
      - itâ€™s possible to use multiple columns as an index
      

## common operations [^2]

- brief information about dataset
  - df.shape, df.info(), df.head()

- show averages: df.mean()
- show standard deviation: df.std(ddof=0)
  - ddof parameter is to turn off bessel's correction [^4]

- select column by name: df.loc[:, 'mycolname']
- select row by label: df.loc['rowlabel', :]
- select value by row and column labels: df.loc['rowlabel', 'collabel']
- select multiple rows by label: df.loc[['rowlabel1', 'rowlabel2'], :]


### finance specific

- having dataframe
  >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'price':  random.randint(100, 200)})
- percentage change of a price: df.pct_change()
- compound return: (df.pct_change() + 1).prod() - 1
