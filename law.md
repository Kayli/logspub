- legally binding action (e.g. agreement)

## software end-user license agreements

- EULA is a license that gives the user the right to use an application. It details how the software application can be used, as well as explains any restrictions

- EULAs are not legally binding. When a consumer agrees to the terms specified in the license agreement, they are actually renting or purchasing a license from the vendor. The downside of a license agreement is that it doesn't protect the consumer. The EULA protects only the copyright owner. In fact, not only does the vendor own the license, but they also legally own any private data that the consumer entered into the software. These software owners can access, read, or share this private consumer data in any way they want.
