## definition [2]

## теория речевых актов [3]

- originated by john austin
  - we use language to do things as well as to assert things [4]

  - defines 3 key modalities
    - locution 
      - is what was said and meant
    - illocution
      - is what was done
    - perlocution
      - is what happened as a result

  - defines 'performative'
    - though they may take the form of a typical indicative sentence
      - performative sentences are not used to describe (or "constate") and are thus not true or false
      - they have no truth-value
    - used not just to "say" something, but rather to perform a certain kind of action
      - act of naming a ship: "i name this ship the queen elizabeth"
      - act of making a will: "i bequeath this watch to my brother"
