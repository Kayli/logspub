## notes on linguistics and related topics

## basics

- syntax: examines sentence structures, principles, and relationships
- semantics: studies aspects of meaning
- pragmatics: study of how context contributes to meaning
- auto-antonym or contronym
  - word with multiple meanings (senses) of which one is the reverse of another
  - combination of homonym (words with similar spelling or pronunciation) and antonym

- morphology
  - study of words, how they are formed, and their relationship to other words in the same language

- hypernym
  - a word with a broad meaning that more specific words fall under; a superordinate. 
  - example: color is a hypernym of red

- hyponym (opposite of hypernym)
  - represents a specific member of that category or a lower-level concept that is subsumed under the hypernym
  - example: animal is a hypernym of cat, dog, fish, etc.

- synonym
  - cognitive synonym ?
    - words so similar in meaning that they cannot be differentiated either denotatively or connotatively, that is, not even by mental associations, connotations, emotive responses, and poetic value
    - it is a stricter (more precise) technical definition of synonymy, specifically for theoretical (e.g., linguistic and philosophical) purposes
  - near synonym
    - synonyms with greater differences

- homophone
  - word that is pronounced the same (to varying extent) as another word but differs in meaning
