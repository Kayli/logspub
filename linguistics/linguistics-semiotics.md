# self-learning course notes about semiotics

## basics

- sign: is anything that communicates a meaning that is not the sign itself to the interpreter of the sign

- different schools of thought that focus on semiotic elements 
  - dyadic (Saussure)
    - sign and signified
  - triadic (Peirce)
    - sign, signified, interpreter
  - quadratic (John Searle)
    - sign, signified, prolocutor (encoder, sender), interpreter (decoder, receiver) 

- denotation
  - the most basic or literal meaning of a sign
  - e.g., the word "rose" signifies a particular kind of flower

- connotation
  - the secondary, cultural meanings of signs; or "signifying signs," signs that are used as signifiers for a secondary meaning, e.g., the word "rose" signifies passion.

- semiosis
  - sign process, is any form of activity, conduct, or process that involves signs, including the production of meaning.

- polysemy: capacity for a sign (e.g. a symbol, a morpheme, a word, or a phrase) to have multiple related meanings


## sign

- something that stands for or represents something else

- categories
  - icon
    - physical resemblance to the signified, the thing being represented
    - example: photograph, movie?
    - 4 types
      - resemblance icons
        - depict direct likenesses of the objects they represent (camera icon for a smartphone camera app)
      - exemplar icons 
        - depict a common example of the class of objects they represent (trowel or rake to represent gardening)
      - symbolic icons 
        - convey a concept at a higher level of abstraction than the object depicted (cracked wineglass to indicate something is fragile)
      - arbitrary icons 
        - have no relationship to an object or concept and their association must be learned (computer on/off power button)
        - hmm, but how they are different from symbols?
  - index
    - shows evidence of what’s being represented
    - examples 
      - image of smoke (to indicate a fire) - todo: double-check, sounds a bit fishy!!!!
  - symbol
    - has no resemblance between the signifier and the signified
    - the connection between them must be culturally learned
    - examples
      - numbers and alphabets

- can be framed as alienated fragment of reality?

- grounding process
  - the meaning of a word on a page is "ungrounded"
  - the meaning of the words in one's head — those words one does understand — are "grounded"
  - to be grounded, the symbol system would have to be augmented with nonsymbolic, sensorimotor capacities—the capacity to interact autonomously with that world of objects, events, actions, properties and states that their symbols are systematically interpretable (by us) as referring
  - can be vewed as robotic turing test, which is hybrid symbolic/sensorimotor

- procedural semantics
  - semantics of natural language sentences can be characterized in a formalism whose meanings are defined by abstract procedures that a computer (or a person) can either execute or reason about. 
  - in this theory 
    - the meaning of a noun is a procedure for recognizing or generating instances
    - the meaning of a proposition is a procedure for determining if it is true or false
    - the meaning of an action is the ability to do the action or to tell if it has been done


## stylistics

- is the study and interpretation of texts or spoken language in regard to their linguistic and tonal style, where style is the particular variety of language used by different individuals and/or in different situations or settings
  - texts are in a broad sense of the word
- is a branch of applied linguistics

- best poems are characterised by semantic density, which is to say a lot of meaning is packed into them [1]

- lipogram
  - a kind of constrained writing or word game 
  - consisting of writing paragraphs or longer works in which a particular letter or group of letters is avoided

- poem is a diary with the lock removed. poetry is communication with oneself as well as with others. it is the most personal of arts. (billy collins)
