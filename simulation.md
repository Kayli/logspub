# notes related to simulations and computer graphics

## basics

- computer-generated imagery (cgi)
  - creates still or animated visual content with computer software

- voxel
  - represents a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space [^1]
  - typically don't encode their position (i.e. coordinates) explicitly with their values
  - rendering systems infer the position of a voxel based upon its position relative to other voxels

- voxel data formats: .vxl, .vox, .kvx, .kv6, .v3a, .v3b

- volumetric meshes
  - regular
  - irregular


## blender

- foss modeling software
- hotkeys
  - view
    - rotate around center: 	middle mouse
    - pan: 					shift + middle mouse
