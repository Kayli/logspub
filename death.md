## organizations

- santhara (sallekhana)
  - religious practice of voluntarily fasting to death by gradually reducing the intake of food and liquids
  - it is not considered as a suicide by Jain scholars because it is not an act of passion, nor does it deploy 
    poisons or weapons. After the sallekhana vow, the ritual preparation and practice can extend into years.
  - one should know how to die, that is one should die like a man, not like a beast, bellowing and panting 
    and making vain efforts to avoid the unavoidable
  - however, actual videos on youtube depict experience looking more like a theatrical torture performance rather than peaceful death

## misonceptions

- overdosing sleeping pills will cause death
  - in most western countries there are now no medically prescribed barbiturate sleeping tablets
  - what remains in the public consciousness, however, is the belief that an overdose of sleeping tablets - any sleeping tablet - will cause death. This misconception leads to many failed suicide attempts as elderly or seriously ill people often stockpile, then take, large numbers of modern, non-lethal sleeping tablets
