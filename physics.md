## classical mechanics

- forces [^3]
  - inertial: acceleration?, centrifugal
  - distance: gravity, electromagnetism
  - contact: pressure, traction, torsion, deformation, friction

- particles of air travel at average velocity of 460 m/s at room temperature


## thermodynamics

- entropy
  - doesn’t really correspond to “disorder” in a well defined way
    - disorder and complexity are very slippery and subjective notions, so better be avoided

- gibbs free energy (also free enthalpy)
  - provides a measure of the amount of energy available to do useful work
  - combines the internal energy and entropy of a system into a single quantity
  - negative gibbs number
    - indicates that you can get energy out of the reaction
    - it is a favorable reaction, which means that the chemical reaction "wants" to move towards its lower state
  - positive gibbs number
    - shows that you must put energy in to get energy out


## liquid dynamics

- salted water boils at higher temperatures and freezes at lower


## particle physics

- four fundamental interactions known to exist
  - gravitational
  - electromagnetic 
  - strong (subatomic)
  - weak (subatomic)

- atoms composed of
  - nucleons (form a nucleus)
    - proton
      - is a hadron
      - composed of
        - two up quarks

- atom properties
  - atomic number
    - number of protons
    - gives 'elemental identity'
      - which groups elements with same number of protons into an 'element' category/group
      - that means elements with bit different composition but same number of protons 
        - are considered as 'isotopes' of the same 'element'
  - mass number
    - is a sum of its protons and neutrons
    - number in a left upper corner of each periodic table element cell  

- neutrino
  - 3 types: electron-neutrino, muon-neutrino, tau-neutrino
  - is a fermion (an elementary particle with spin of 1/2) 
  - created by various radioactive decays
  - interacts only via
    - weak force
    - gravity
  - electrically (electromagnetically?) neutral
    - meaning it does not interact with photons
  - rest mass is much smaller than that of the other known elementary particle
    - less than 0.120 eV (< 2.14 × 10−37 kg), 95% confidence level, sum of 3 flavors

- electromagnetism
  - relationship between electric and magnetic fields
    - a change in one produces a change in the other
    - electromagnetic wave consists of both type of fields, which are oscillating back and forth
    - is what allows the formation of electromagnetic waves
    - fundamental to the working of the universe in its present form
    - read more: https://www.newscientist.com/lastword/mg24632872-000-whats-the-difference-between-an-electric-and-a-magnetic-field/#ixzz6hL7oZRnf
  - there is an electric current - flow of electrons
    - there is also a magnetic current, which is considered 'ficticious'
      - i don't understand what it means
      - an artifact of a model without real physical phenomena corresponding to it?
      - is it analogous to "electron hole" or "hole current" quasiphenomena?
  - it has been understood that Maxwell's equations do not give an exact description of electromagnetic phenomena, 
    but are instead describe it as a classical limit of the more precise theory of quantum electrodynamics

## general relativity

- natural units
  - physical units of measurement based only on universal physical constants
  - base Planck units: length, mass, time, temperature, charge
  - scale of the Planck length
    - roughly the order of magnitude around which the structure of spacetime becomes dominated by quantum effects
    - roughly the scale of the “quantum foam”
  - gravitational attractive force of two bodies of 1 Planck mass each, set apart by 1 Planck length 
    is 1 coherent Planck unit of force
  - distance traveled by light during 1 Planck time is 1 Planck length
  - speed of light c 
    - is a natural unit of speed
    - 299792.458km/s  (referred as approx 300000 km/s)
    - e=mc^2 interpretation
      - the numerical value of the speed of light is set to equal 1
      - and the formula expresses an equality of numerical values: E = m
  - elementary charge e 
    - is a natural unit of electric charge
    - usually denoted by e or sometimes qe 
    - is the electric charge carried by a single proton
    - or, equivalently, the magnitude of the negative electric charge carried by a single electron
      - which has charge −1 e

- general relativity takes into account the effects of gravity, while special relativity does not

- time and gravity
  - clock slows down getting closer to the source of gravitation and vice versa


## astrophysics

  - age - 8.08 × 10^60 tP 	4.35 × 10^17 s, or 13.8 × 10^9 years
  - diameter - 5.4 × 10^61 lP 	8.7 × 10^26 m or 9.2 × 10^10 light-years

  - density 	1.8 × 10^−123 ρP 	9.9 × 10^−27 kg m−3
  - temperature 	1.9 × 10^−32 TP 	2.725 K temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation


## optics

- octaves of light
  - in music, an octave is the interval between a pitch, and a second pitch with double the first pitch's frequency
  - we barely have the ability to perceive an entire "octave" of light
  - our visible spectrum is approximately 375Thz (800nm) to 750Thz (400nm)
    - so the highest frequency violet we can see is approximately one octave higher than the deepest red we can see
    - none of the other colors have a visible octave


## electromagnetism

- charged particles: electron, positron
- charged atoms (ions)
  - two types of ions
    - cations - positively charged ions
    - anions - negatively charged ions
- charged molecules

- maxwell equations
  - set of coupled partial differential equations that, together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, classical optics, and electric circuits
  - for a region with no charges (ρ = 0) and no currents (J = 0), such as in a vacuum
    - standard wave equations form can be used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation
    - speed of light derived as c=sqrt( 1 / (μ0 * ϵ0) )  where 
      - ϵ0 is the electric permittivity constant
              - it is the capability of an electric field to permeate a vacuum
              - determined by the value of μ0 (since 2019 redefinition of elementary charge as an exact number of coulombs)
      - μ0 is the magnetic permeability constant (магнитная проницаемость)
        - experimentally derived from ampère's force law: for two thin, straight, stationary, parallel wires, 
          a distance r apart, in each of which a current I flows, the force per unit length, Fm/L, that one wire 
          exerts upon the other in the vacuum of free space
      - see for more details https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permeability

## optics

- coloration
  - pigment: specific molecule is responsible for color
  - structural: microstructure of material is responsible for color


## math

- homogeneous
  - material or system, has the same properties at every point, it is uniform without irregularities
  - homogeneity has the connotation of invariance
    - for example: invariance towards space or time coordinates
  - homogeneity of materials does not necessarily mean isotropy
    - depends on a context
    - if macro (emergent?) properties of an object are of the most importance for the current model
  - homogeneity (in space) implies conservation of momentum
  - homogeneity in time implies conservation of energy
  - dimensional homogeneity 
    - is the quality of an equation having quantities of same units on both sides
    - dimensionality of a property can be viewed/modeled as a metainformation about its quantity
      - invariant that can be enforced as an extra verification step
      - can be used to spot errors in formula or calculations
