# July 8, Wednesday

- reading materials for the coursera "fundamentals of reinforcement learning" [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fundamentals-of-reinforcement-learning)
  - main challenges: exploration vs exploitation tradeoff
  - major types of ML
    - supervised learning
      - it is most common ML method, but is defferent from RL
      - deals with labeled data and training sets
    - unsupervised learning
      - uncovering hidden structures in unlabeled data
    - reinforcement learning
      - agent interacting over time with its environment to achieve a goal
      - tasks that RL focuses on: sensation, action, goal
