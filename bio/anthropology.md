# notes on topics of anthropology and related themes


## basics

- anthropology 
  - is the scientific study of humanity, concerned with human behavior, human biology, cultures and societies
  - in both the present and past
  - including past human species

- allochronism
  - biological
    - temporal separation of populations or species that might otherwise be capable of interbreeding
    - can lead to reproductive isolation and potentially to speciation
  
  - anthropological
    - perception of cultures as existing in different time periods
    - this can often reflect an ethnocentric view where one culture is seen as "modern" and another as "primitive" or "ancient," despite both existing in the same historical time frame
    - power dynamics
      - dominant cultures often have the power to construct narratives about other cultures, which can lead to allochronistic depictions. These representations can portray other cultures as "timeless" "primitive," or "stuck in the past," reinforcing the dominance of the depicting culture and marginalizing the depicted one


## taxonomy

- eight major taxonomic ranks describing carbon life
  - domain
  - kingdom
  - phylum
  - class
  - order
  - family
  - genus (род)
    - a principal taxonomic category that ranks above species and below family
    - is denoted by a capitalized Latin name, e.g. Leo
  - species
    - subspecies (races for humans)


## ancestors

- for simplicity, people often refer to a common ancestor as to an individual
  - however, in reality it was a closely related group sharing genes on a regular basis

- last common ancestor with chimpanzee
  - last one thats shared by the following Hominini generas
    - Homo (human)
    - Pan (chimpanzee and bonobo)
  - lived 13 million years ago (miocene)
    - hybridization may have been ongoing until as recently as 4 million years ago (pliocene)


- hominid timeline [6]
  - 55 mya first primitive primates
  - 18-15 mya proconsul
    - it is ancestral to the chimpanzee
  - 7 mya common ancestor of gorillas, chimps and humans
  - 5.8 mya orrorin tugenensis
    - oldest human ancestor thought to have walked on two legs
  - 5.5 mya ardipithecus
    - early “proto-human” shares traits with chimps and gorillas, and is forest-dwelling
  - 4 mya australopithecines
    - have brains no larger than a chimpanzee’s with a volume around 400-500 cm3
    - walk upright on two legs
    - first human ancestors to live on the savannah
    - theropithecus oswaldi pushed them out of ecological niche https://youtu.be/t4Bp7sGCpO8?t=3639
      - giant geladas
      - which forced hominids to start growing bigger brains in order to adapt for new niche
  - 3.2 mya australopithecus afarensis
    - lucy, famous specimen lived near what is now Hadar, Ethiopia
  - 2.7 mya paranthropus
    - lives in woods and grasslands
    - has massive jaws for chewing on roots and vegetation
  - 2.5 mya homo habilis
    - its face protrudes less than earlier hominids, but still retains many ape features
    - has a brain volume of around 600 cm3
    - hominids start to use stone tools regularly, created by splitting pebbles
    - some hominids develop meat-rich diets as scavengers
      - the extra energy may have favoured the evolution of larger brains
  - 2 mya homo ergaster
    - brain volume of up to 850 cm3, in Africa
  - 1.8 – 1.5 mya homo erectus
    - first true hunter-gatherer ancestor, first to have migrated out of Africa in large numbers
    - found in Asia
    - attains a brain size of around 1000 cm3
  - 1.6 mya possible first sporadic use of fire 
    - suggested by discoloured sediments in Koobi Fora, Kenya
    - more convincing evidence of charred wood and stone tools is found in Israel and dated to 780k years ago
  - 600 kya homo heidelbergensis
    - lives in Africa and Europe
    - similar brain capacity to modern humans, 1300 cm3
  - 500 kya earliest evidence of purpose-built shelters 
    - wooden huts, are known from sites near Chichibu, Japan
  - 430 kya neanderthals
    - brain size 1410 cm3
    - type specimen, Neanderthal 1, was found in the Neander Valley in present-day Germany
    - humans have less than 2% of neanderthals genome (cross-breeding)
  - 400 kya early humans begin to hunt with spears
  - 195 kya homo sapiens 
    - begins to migrate across Asia and Europe
    - oldest modern human remains are two skulls found in Ethiopia that date to this period
  - 150 kya humans possibly capable of speech
  - 140 kya first evidence of long-distance trade
  - 50 kya people begin burying their dead ritually
    - create clothes from animal hides and develop complex hunting techniques, such as pit-traps
    - reached australia
  - 40 kya neanderthal extinction [5]
  - 33 kya oldest cave art
  - 12 kya modern people reach the Americas
  - 12 kya red deer cave people extinction [5]
  - 10 kya agriculture develops and spread, first villages, possible domestication of dogs
  - 5,5 kya bronze age (stone age ends) humans begin to smelt and work copper and tin
  - 5 kya earliest known writing
  - 4-3 kya world’s first civilisation: sumerians of mesopotamia


## great apes

- members are known as great apes or hominids (/ˈhɒmɪnɪdz/)
  - taxonomic family of primates that includes eight extant species in four genera: 
    - Pongo (the Bornean, Sumatran and Tapanuli orangutan)
    - Gorilla (the eastern and western gorilla)
    - Pan (the chimpanzee and the bonobo)
    - Homo (of which only modern humans remain)


## hybridization

- hybrids are possible (but rare) between following taxonomic ranks: order, family, genus, species
  - interfamilial hybrids (between different families)
    - such as between chickens and guineafowl or pheasants, are reliably described but extremely rare.
  - interordinal hybrids (between different orders)
    -  are few, but have been made with 
      - the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (female) and the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus (male)
- horizontal gene transfer is another way to share/spread genetic material

## dominance

- alpha male savanna baboons 
  - have high levels of testosterone and stress
    - over a long period of time, this can lead to decreased fitness
  - lowest ranking males also had high stress levels
  - it is the beta males that gain the most fitness
    - avoiding stress but receiving some of the benefits of moderate rank


## dating methods [7]

- can be
  - relative
    - стратиграфия
      - копаем слои земли: что ниже, то - древнее (если очень упростить)
    - типология
      - выстраивание находок в типологический ряд
        - отслеживание постепенных изменений в эволюции находок
      - сравнение с уже существующим рядом, т.е. куда находку в этом ряду можно "вставить"

  - absolute
    - suitable for organic matter
      - радиоуглеродный метод (открыт в 1949)
        - применяется для органических находок, например костей скелета
        - проверяется содержание изотопа углерода 14
        - после 70 тыс лет точность метода падает
        - также применяется датирование не самой находки, а находок окружающей фауны в том же слое
      - степень минерализации кости
      - racemization
      - электрон-спино-резонанс
        - для эмали зубов
    
    - for inorganic matter
      - калий-аргонный метод
        - 1.3 миллиарда лет назад
 

## other

- juvenile traits of chimps resemble human traits [8]
- first forms of cave art 40k years ago [9]
