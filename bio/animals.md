# notes related to animals

## basics

- most games that animals play are not competitive and more focused on togetherness [1]
  - quote from frans de waal, but maybe politically twisted?
  - but one does not exclude the other, as there are different degrees of competitiveness i guess


## birds

- all birds have extra cones in their eyes that allowed them to see ultraviolet light
  - that along with specific pigments on their feather, that we humans can't see, may allow them to identify each other and their gender

- turkeys
  - wild turkeys can fly, while domesticated turkeys can't

- red junglefowl
  - during their mating season
    - the male birds announce their presence with the well known "cock-a-doodle-doo" call or crowing
    - within flocks, only dominant males crow
  - regularly bathe in dust to keep the right balance of oil in their plumage
    - the dust absorbs extra oil and subsequently falls off

- chicken was domesticated from red junglefowl about 8,000 years ago
  - was native to india and southeast asia
  - 71–79% of red junglefowl DNA is shared with the domestic chicken [3]
    - diverged 4–6 million years ago
    - means that it takes about 30% of dna to turn a bird into a slave, that's a spirit!
