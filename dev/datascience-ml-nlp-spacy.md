# library: spacy

- tasks: part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (ner), and dependency parsing
- encodes all strings to hash values to reduce memory usage and improve efficiency
- pipeline
  - does not support stream processing of data
  - whole text is converted into a document object
  - document object passed from one step of pipeline to the other


- data extraction articles
  - https://www.kaggle.com/code/pavansanagapati/knowledge-graph-nlp-tutorial-bert-spacy-nltk
    - see 'relations extraction' and 'build knowledge graph' sections

- split text into sentences
  >>> from spacy.lang.en import English
  >>> nlp = English()
  >>> nlp.add_pipe('sentencizer')
  >>> doc = nlp(text)
  >>> print(doc.sents)
