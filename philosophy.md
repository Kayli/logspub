## postmodernism

  - these terms are attempts to mask differences, pluralistic and playful complexity of the world

    is trapped in that state - it may be a life not worth living

    - subtypes
      - utilitarian
      - personal (nitzsche)
        - ideal human, uberman
  - semantic (tarski theory of truth)
    - idea has to conform to a statement (sentense) expressed in some fixed language
    - axioms define initial truth statements 
    - theorems define truth statements derived from axioms and other proven theorems (sometimes referred as recursive definition)


## relativism, antirealism

- standards of truth, rationality, and ethical right and wrong vary greatly between cultures and historical epochs 
  - there are no universal criteria for picking best between them


## evolutionary epistemology

- main contributors: karl popper, konrad lorenz, donald campbell
- lorenz writes: kant's synthetic apriori is true in light of darwinian biology
  - our cognitive apparatus evolved under to pressure of things in themselves in order to percieve them in ways that matter for survival


## causality

- relationship between an event (the cause) and a second event (the effect), where the second event is a result of the first

- can be established through experimental design 
  - researchers manipulate an independent variable and measure its effect on a dependent variable

- theories of causality

  - deterministic
    - every effect has a single, definite cause that can be traced back to a previous event or state

  - probabilistic
    - effect may have multiple possible causes, each with a certain probability of occurring
    - bayesian networks
      - represented by conditional probabilities that specify the likelihood of an effect given its possible causes

  - counterfactual/interventionist
    - cause is an event that, if it had not occurred, would have prevented the effect from occurring

  - agency theories
    - actions of agents who intentionally bring about the effect

- establishing causality
  - in medicine: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
  - no causation without manipulation (paul holland)
    - to find out what happens when you change something, it is necessary to change it
    - there are things you learn from perturbing a system that you'll never find out from any amount of passive observation. [^5]


## space and time

- space and time are mental constructs
  - leibniz, kant and einstein were proponents of this idea 
  - emerge from interactions between different parts of matter


## taoism, daoism

- yin and yang
  - describes opposite but interconnected forces
  - yin is the receptive and yang the active principle


## hellenism

- epicurianism: self-sufficiency, pleasure, friendship, materialism
- cynics: don't care about social conventions (diogenes)
- stoics: fatalism, dog tight to a cart being moved by a horse
- scepticism: suspend judgement as we never can be fully certain
- neoplatonism
- aristotelianism


## interesting ideas

- "consciousness is always present for itself" thomas w. clark 
- reincarnation is just a poetic expression of what collective memory is [^2]
- embracing anxiety as a natural emotion that animates body [^3]
- бытие определяет сознание ... еще это назвают проф деформацией [^4]
